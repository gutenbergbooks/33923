<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>This book attempts the discussion of two very
important problems in primary education. First, the
oral work in the handling of stories, and second, the
introduction to the art of reading in the earliest
school work. The very close relation between the
oral work in stories and the exercises in reading in
the first three years in school is quite fully explained.
The oral work in story-telling has gained a great
importance in recent years, but has not received
much discussion from writers of books on method.</p>

<p>Following this "Special Method in Primary Reading,"
a second volume, called the "Special Method
in the Reading of Complete English Classics in the
Grades of the Common School," completes the discussion
of reading and literature in the intermediate
and grammar grades.</p>

<p>Both of the books of Special Method are an application
of the ideas discussed in "The Principles
of General Method" and "The Method of the
Recitation."</p>

<p>Still other volumes of Special Method in Geography,
History, and Natural Science furnish the outlines
of the courses of study in these subjects, and
also a full discussion of the value of the material
selected and of the method of treatment.</p>

<p>At the close of each chapter and at the end of the
book a somewhat complete graded list of books, for
the use of both pupils and teachers, is given. The
same plan is followed in all the books of this series,
so that teachers may be able to supply themselves
with the best helps with as little trouble as possible.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">The Reason for Oral Work in Stories</span></h2>


<p>The telling and reading of stories to children in
early years, before they have mastered the art of
reading, is of such importance as to awaken the
serious thought of parents and teachers. To older
people it is a source of constant surprise&mdash;the attentive
interest which children bestow upon stories.
Almost any kind of a story will command their wide-awake
thought. But the tale which they can fully
understand and enjoy has a unique power to concentrate
their mental energy. There is an undivided,
unalloyed absorption of mind in good stories which
augurs well for all phases of later effort. To get
children into this habit of undivided mental energy,
of singleness of purpose in study, is most promising.
In primary grades, the fluttering, scatter-brained truancy
of thought is the chronic obstacle to success in
study.</p>

<p>The telling or reading of stories to children natu<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 2]</span>rally
begins at home, before the little ones are old
enough for school. The mother and father, the aunts
and uncles, and any older person who delights in
children, find true comfort and entertainment in rehearsing
the famous stories to children. The Mother
Goose, the fables, the fairy tales, the "Arabian
Nights," Eugene Field's and Stevenson's poems of
child life, the Bible stories, the myths, and some of
the old ballads have untold treasures for children. If
one has a voice for singing the old melodies, the
charm of music intensifies the effect. Little ones
quickly memorize what delights them, and not seldom,
after two or three readings, children of three
and four years will be heard repeating whole poems
or large parts of them. The repetition of the songs
and stories till they become thoroughly familiar gives
them their full educative effect. They become a
part of the permanent furniture of the mind. If the
things which the children learn in early years have
been well selected from the real treasures of the past
(of which there is a goodly store), the seeds of true
culture have been deeply sown in their affections.</p>

<p>The opportunities of the home for good story-telling
are almost boundless. Parents who perceive
its worth and are willing to take time for it, find in
this early period greater opportunity to mould the
lives of children and put them into sympathetic touch
with things of beauty and value than at any other
time. At this age children are well-nigh wholly at<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3]</span>
the mercy of their elders. They will take what we
give them and take it at its full worth or worthlessness.
They absorb these things as the tender plant
absorbs rain and sunshine.</p>

<p>The kindergarten has naturally found in the story
one of its chief means of effectiveness. Stories,
songs, and occupations are its staples. Dealing with
this same period of early childhood, before the more
taxing work of the school begins, it finds that the
children's minds move with that same freedom and
spontaneity in these stories with which their bodies
and physical energies disport themselves in games
and occupations.</p>

<p>It is fortunate for childhood that we have such
wholesome and healthful material, which is fitted
to give a child's mental action a well-rounded completeness.
His will, his sensibility, and his knowing
faculty, all in one harmonious whole, are brought
into full action. In short, not a fragment but the
whole child is focussed and concentrated upon one
absorbing object of thought.</p>

<p>The value of the oral treatment of stories is found
in the greater clearness and interest with which they
can be presented orally. There is a keener realism,
a closer approximation to experimental facts, to the
situations, the hardships, to the sorrows and triumphs
of persons. The feelings and impulses of the actors
in the story are felt more sharply. The reality of the
surrounding conditions and difficulties is presented so<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 4]</span>
that a child transports himself by the power of sympathy
and imagination into the scenes described.</p>

<p>There is no way by which this result can be accomplished
in early years except by the oral presentation
of stories. Until the children have learned to read
and have acquired sufficient mastery of the art of
reading so that it is easy and fluent, there is no way
by which they can get at good stories for themselves.
Average children require about three years to acquire
this mastery of the reading art. Not many children
read stories from books, with enjoyment and appreciation,
till they are nine or ten years old; but from
the age of four to ten they are capable of receiving
an infinite amount of instruction and mental stimulus
from hearing good stories. In fact, many of the best
stories ever produced in the history of the world can
be thoroughly enjoyed by children before they have
learned to read. This is true of Grimm's and Andersen's
stories, of the myths of Hiawatha and Norseland,
and of the early Greeks, of the Bible stories,
the "Arabian Nights," "Robin Hood," besides many
other stories, poems, ballads, and biographies which
are among the best things in our literature.</p>

<p>In these early years the minds of children may be
enriched with a furnishment of ideas of much value
for all their future use, a sort of capital well invested,
which will bring rich returns. Minds early fertilized
with this variety of thought material become more
flexible, productive, and acquisitive.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 5]</span></p>

<p>For many years, and even centuries, it was supposed
that early education could furnish children with
little except the forms and instruments of knowledge,
the tools of acquisition, such as ability to read, spell,
and write, and to use simple numbers. But the susceptibility
of younger children to the powerful culture
influence of story, poem, and nature study, was
overlooked.</p>

<p>We now have good reason to believe that there
is no period when the educative and refining influences
of good literature in the form of poems and
story can be made so effective as in this early period
from four to ten years. That period which has been
long almost wholly devoted to the dry formalities and
mechanics of knowledge, to the dull and oftentimes
benumbing drills of alphabets, spelling, and arithmetical
tables, is found to be capable of a fruitful study
of stories, fables, and myths, and an indefinite extension
of ideas and experiences in nature observation.</p>

<p>But the approach to these sunny fields of varied
and vivid experience is not through books, except
as the teacher's mind has assimilated their materials
and prepared them for lively presentation.</p>

<p>The oral speech through which the stories are
given to children is completely familiar to them, so
that they, unencumbered by the forms of language,
can give their undivided thought to the story. Oral
speech is, therefore, the natural channel through
which stories should come in early years. The book<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 6]</span>
is at first wholly foreign to them, and it takes them
three years or more of greater or less painful effort
to get such easy mastery of printed forms as to gain
ready access to thought in books. A book, when
first put into the hands of a child, is a complete
obstruction to thought. The oral story, on the contrary,
is a perfectly transparent medium of thought.
A child can see the meaning of a story through oral
speech as one sees a landscape through a clear window-pane.
If a child, therefore, up to the age of
ten, is to get many and delightsome views into the
fruitful fields of story-land, this miniature world of
all realities, this repository of race ideas, it must
be through oral speech which he has already acquired
in the years of babyhood.</p>

<p>It is an interesting blunder of teachers, and one
that shows their unreflecting acceptance of traditional
customs, to assume that the all-absorbing problem
of primary instruction is the acquisition of a new
book language (the learning to read), and to ignore
that rich mother tongue, already abundantly familiar,
as an avenue of acquisition and culture. But we
are now well convinced that the ability to read is an
instrument of culture, not culture itself, and primarily
the great object of education is to inoculate
the children with the ideas of our civilization. The
forms of expression are also of great value, but they
are secondary and incidental as compared with the
world of ideas.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 7]</span></p>

<p>There is an intimate connection between learning
to read and the oral treatment of stories in primary
schools which is very interesting and suggestive to
the teacher. Routine teachers may think it a waste
of time to stop for the oral presentation of stories.
But the more thoughtful and sympathetic teacher
will think it better to stimulate the child's mind than
to cram his memory. The young mind fertilized by
ideas is quicker to learn the printed forms than a
mind barren of thought. Yet this proposition needs
to be seen and illustrated in many forms.</p>

<p>Children should doubtless make much progress in
learning to read in the first year of school. But
coincident with these exercises in primary reading,
and, as a general thing, preliminary to them, is a
lively and interested acquaintance with the best
stories. It is a fine piece of educative work to cultivate
in children, at the beginning of school life, a
real appreciation and enjoyment of a few good stories.
These stories, thus rendered familiar, and others of
similar tone and quality, may serve well as a part of
the reading lessons. It is hardly possible to cultivate
this literary taste in the reading books alone, unrelieved
by oral work. The primers and first readers,
when examined, will give ample proof of this statement.
In spite of the utmost effort of skilled
primary teachers to make attractive books for primary
children, our primers and first readers show
unmistakable signs of their formal and mechanical
character. They are essentially drill books.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 8]</span></p>

<p>It seems well, therefore, to have in primary
schools two kinds of work in connection with story
and reading, the oral work in story-telling, reproduction,
expression, etc., and the drill exercises in learning
to read. The former will keep up a wide-awake
interest in the best thought materials suitable for
children, the latter will gradually acquaint them with
the necessary forms of written and printed language.
Moreover, the interest aroused in the stories is constantly
transferring itself to the reading lessons and
giving greater spirit and vitality even to the primary
efforts at learning to read. In discussing the method
of primary reading we shall have occasion to mention
the varied devices of games, activities, drawings,
dramatic action, blackboard exercises, and picture
work, by which an alert primary teacher puts life
and motive into early reading work, but fully as
important as all these things put together is the
growing insight and appreciation for good stories.
When a child makes the discovery, as Hugh Miller
said, "that learning to read is learning to get stories
out of books" he has struck the chord that should
vibrate through all his future life. The real motive
for reading is to get something worth the effort of
reading. Even if it takes longer to accomplish the
result in this way, the result when accomplished is
in all respects more valuable. But it is probable that
children will learn to read fully as soon who spend
a good share of their time in oral story work.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 9]</span></p>

<p>In discussing the literary materials used in the first
four grades, we suggest the following grading of
certain large groups of literary matter, and the relation
of oral work to the reading in each subsequent
grade is clearly marked.</p>

<p>This close dependence of reading proper, in earlier
years, upon the oral treatment of stories as a preliminary,
is based fundamentally upon the idea that
suitable and interesting thought matter is the true
basis of progress in reading, and that the strengthening
of the taste for good books is a much greater
thing than the mere acquisition of the art of reading.
The motive with which children read or try to learn
to read is, after all, of the greatest consequence.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 10]</span></p>

<p>The old notion that children must first learn to
read and then find, through the mastery of this art,
the entrance to literature is exactly reversed. First
awaken a desire for things worth reading, and then
incorporate these and similar stories into the regular
reading exercises as far as possible.</p>

<p>In accordance with this plan, children, by the time
they are nine or ten years old, will become heartily
acquainted with three or four of the great classes
of literature, the fables, fairy tales, myths, and such
world stories as Crusoe, Aladdin, Hiawatha, and
Ulysses. Moreover, the oral treatment will bring
these persons and actions closer to their thought and
experience than the later reading alone could do.
In fact, if children have reached their tenth year
without enjoying those great forms of literature that
are appropriate to childhood, there is small prospect
that they will ever acquire a taste for them. They
have passed beyond the age where a liking for
such literature is most easily and naturally cultivated.
They move on to other things. They have passed
through one great stage of education and have
emerged with a meagre and barren outfit.</p>

<p>The importance of oral work as a lively means of
entrance to studies is seen also in other branches
besides literature.</p>

<p>In geography and history the first year or two of
introductory study is planned for the best schools in
the form of oral narrative and discussion. Home<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 11]</span>
geography in the third or fourth year, and history
stories in the fourth and fifth years of school, are
best presented without a text book by the teacher.
Although the children have already overcome, to
some extent, the difficulty of reading, so great is the
power of oral presentation and discussion to vivify
and realize geographical and historical scenes that
the book is discarded at first for the oral treatment.</p>

<p>In natural science also, from the first year on the
teacher must employ an oral method of treatment.
The use of books is not only impossible, but even
after the children have learned to read, it would
defeat the main purpose of instruction to make books
the chief means of study. The ability to observe
and discern things, to use their own senses in discriminating
and comparing objects, in experiments
and investigations, is the fundamental purpose.</p>

<p>In language lessons, again, it is much better to use
a book only as a guide and to handle the lessons
orally, collecting examples and stories from other
studies as the basis for language discussions.</p>

<p>It is apparent from this brief survey that an oral
method is appropriate to the early treatment of all
the common school studies, that it gives greater
vivacity, intensity, simplicity, and clearness to all
such introductory studies.</p>

<p>The importance of story-telling and the initiation
of children into the delightful fields of literature<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 12]</span>
through the teacher rather than through the book
are found to harmonize with a mode of treatment
common to all the studies in early years.</p>

<p>In this connection it is interesting to observe that
the early literature of the European nations was
developed and communicated to the people by word
of mouth. The Homeric songs were chanted or
sung at the courts of princes. At Athens, in her
palmy days, the great dramatists and poets either
recited their productions to the people or had them
presented to thousands of citizens in the open-air
theatres. Even historians like Thucidides read or
recited their great histories before the assembled
people. In the early history of England, Scotland,
and other countries, the minstrels sang their ballads
and epic poems in the baronial halls and thus developed
the early forms of music and poetry.
Shakespeare wrote his dramas for the theatre, and
he seems to have paid no attention at all to their
appearance in book form, never revising them or
putting them into shape for the press.</p>

<p>This practice of all the early races of putting their
great literature before the people by song, dramatic
action, and word of mouth is very suggestive to the
teacher. The power and effectiveness of this mode
of presentation, not only in early times but even in
the highly civilized cities of London and Athens, is
unmistakable proof of the educative value of such
modes of teaching. This is only another indication<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 13]</span>
of the kinship of child life with race life, which has
been emphasized by many great thinkers.</p>

<p>The oral method offers a better avenue for all vigorous
modes of expression than the reading book.
It can be observed that the general tendency of the
book is toward a formal, expressionless style in
young readers. Go into a class where the teacher is
handling a story orally and you will see her falling
naturally into all forms of vivid narrative and presentation,
gesture, facial expression, versatile intonation,
blackboard sketching and picture work, the
impersonation of characters in dialogue, dramatic
action, and general liveliness of manner. The children
naturally take up these same activities and modes
of uttering themselves. Even without the suggestion
of teachers, little children express themselves in such
actions, attitudes, and impersonations. This may be
often observed in little boys and girls of kindergarten
age, when telling their experiences to older persons,
or when playing among themselves. The freedom,
activity, and vivacity of children is, indeed, in strong
contrast to the apathetic, expressionless, monotonous
style of many grown people, including teachers.</p>

<p>But the oral treatment of stories has a tendency to
work out into modes of activity even more effective
than those just described.</p>

<p>In recent years, since so much oral work has been
done in elementary schools, children have been encouraged
also to express themselves freely in black<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 14]</span>board
drawings and in pencil work at their desks by
way of illustrating the stories told. Moreover, in
paper cutting, to represent persons and scenes, in
clay modelling, to mould objects presented, and
in constructive and building efforts, in making forts,
tents, houses, tools, dress, and in showing up modes
of life, the children have found free scope for their
physical and mental activities. These have not only
led to greater clearness and vividness in their mental
conceptions, but have opened out new fields of self-activity
and inventiveness.</p>

<p>So long as work in reading and literature was confined
to the book exercises, nearly all these modes of
expression were little employed and even tabooed.</p>

<p>Finally, the free use of oral narrative in the literature
of early years, in story-telling and its attendant
modes of expression, opens up to primary teachers
a rare opportunity of becoming genuine educators.
There was a time, and it still continues with many
primary teachers, when teaching children to read
was a matter of pure routine, of formal verbal drills
and repetitions, as tiresome to the teacher, if possible,
as to the little ones. But now that literature, with its
treasures of thought and feeling, of culture and refinement,
has become the staple of the primary
school, teachers have a wide and rich field of inspiring
study. The mastery and use of much of the
preferred literature which has dropped down to us
out of the past is the peculiar function of the pri<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 15]</span>mary
teacher. Contact with great minds, like those
of Kingsley, Ruskin, Andersen, the Grimm brothers,
Stevenson, Dickens, Hawthorne, De Foe, Browning,
&AElig;sop, Homer, and the unknown authors of many of
the best ballads, epics, and stories, is enough to give
the primary teacher a sense of the dignity of her
work. On the other hand, the opportunity to give to
children the free and versatile development of their
active powers is an equal encouragement.</p>

<p>Teachers who have taken up with zeal this great
problem of introducing children to their full birthright,
the choice literature of the world suited to their
years, and of linking this story work with primary
reading so as to give it vitality,&mdash;such teachers have
found school life assuming new and unwonted
charms; the great problems of the educator have
become theirs; the broadened opportunity for the
acquisition of varied skill and professional efficiency
has given a strong ambitious tone to their work.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">The Basis of Skill in Oral Work</span></h2>


<p>Accepting the statement that skill in oral presentation
of a story is a prime demand in early education,
the important question for teachers is how to
cultivate their resources in this phase of teaching,
how to become good story-tellers.</p>

<p>It may be remarked that, for the great majority of
people, story-telling is not a gift but an acquisition.
There are, of course, occasional geniuses, but they
may be left out of consideration. They are not
often found in the schoolroom any more than in
other walks of life. What we need is a practical,
sensible development of a power which we all possess
in varying degrees. Nor is it the fluent, volatile,
verbose talker who makes a good oral teacher, but
rather one who can see and think clearly: one who
knows how to combine his ideas and experiences into
clear and connected series of thought.</p>

<p>We may proceed, therefore, to a discussion of the
needs and resources of a good story-teller.</p>

<p>1. Without much precaution it may be stated that
he should have a rich experience in all the essential
realities of human life. This covers a large field of<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 17]</span>
common things and refers rather to contact with life
than to mere book knowledge. Yet it is the depth,
heartiness, and variety of knowledge rather than
the source from which it springs that concerns us.
Books often give us just this deep penetrating experience,
as soon as we learn how to select and
use them. We need to know human life directly
and in all sorts of acts, habits, feelings, motives,
and conditions,&mdash;something as Shakespeare knew it,
only within the compass of our narrower possibilities.
Likewise the physical world with its visible
and invisible forces and objects besetting us on every
side. These things must impress themselves upon
us vividly in detail as well as in the bulk. The hand
that has been calloused by skill-producing labor, the
back that aches with burdens bravely borne, the
brain that has sweat with strong effort, are expressions
of this kind of knowledge of the world. Clear-grained
perceptions are acquired from many sources:
from travel, labor, books, reflection, sickness, observation.
I go to-day into a small shop where heavy oak
beer-kegs are made, and watch the man working this
refractory material into water-tight kegs that will
stand hard usage at the hands of hard drinkers for
twenty years. If my mind has been at work as I
watch this man for an hour, with his heavy rough
staves made by hand, his tools and machines, his
skill and strong muscular action, the amount and
profit of his labor, that man's work has gone deep<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 18]</span>
into my whole being. I can almost live his life in
an hour's time, and feel its contact with the acute
problems of our modern industrial life. That is a
kind of knowledge and experience worth fully as
much as a sermon in Trinity Church or a University
lecture.</p>

<p>The teacher needs a great store of these concrete
facts and illustrations. Without them he is a carpenter
without tools or boards. He needs to know
industries, occupations, good novels, typical life
scenes, sunsets, sorrows, joys, inventions, poets,
farmers&mdash;all such common, tangible things. Even
from fools and blackguards he can get experiences
that will last him a lifetime if they only strike in and
do not flare off into nothingness.</p>

<p>Social experience in all sorts of human natures,
disposition, and environing circumstance is immediately
valuable to the teacher.</p>

<p>Close acquaintance with children, with their early
feelings and experiences, with their timidity or boldness,
with their whims or conceits, their dislikes and
preferences, their enthusiasms and interests, with their
peculiar home and neighborhood experiences and
surroundings, with their games and entertainments,
with the books and papers they read, with their dolls
and playthings, their vacations and outings, with
their pets and playhouses, with their tools and
mechanical contrivances&mdash;all these and other like
realities of child life put the teacher on a footing<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 19]</span>
of possible appreciation and sympathy with children.
These are the materials and facts which a good
teacher knows how to work up in oral recitations.</p>

<p>Of course the kindly, sympathetic social mood
which is not fretted by others' frailties and perversities,
but, like Irving or Addison, exhibits a liberal
charity or humorous affection for all things human, is
a fortunate possession or acquisition for the teacher.</p>

<p>2. It may be said also, without fear of violent contradiction,
that a teacher needs to be a master of the
story he is about to tell. It may be well to spread
out to view the important things necessary to such a
mastery. The reading over of the story till its facts
and episodes have become familiar and can be reproduced
in easy narrative is at least a minimum requirement.
Even this moderate demand is much
more serious than the old text-book routine in history
or reading, where the teacher, with one eye on the
book, the other on the class, and his finger at the
place, managed to get the questions before the class
in a fixed order.</p>

<p>Let us look a little beneath the surface of the
story. What is its central idea, the author's aim or
motive in producing it? Not a little effort and reflection
may be necessary to get at the bottom of this
question. Some of the most famous stories, like "Aladdin,"
"Gulliver's Travels," and the "City Musicians,"
may be so wild and wayward as to elude or blunt the
point of this question. The story may have a hard<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 20]</span>
shell, but the sharp teeth of reflection will get at the
sweet kernel within, else the story is not worth while.
In some of the stories, like "Baucis and Philemon,"
"The Great Stone Face," "The Pied Piper of Hamelin,"
"The Discontented Pine Tree," and "Hiawatha's
Fasting," the main truth is easily reflected
from the story and caught up even by the children.</p>

<p>This need for getting at the heart of the story is
clearly seen in all the subsequent work. It is the
exercise of such a critical judgment which qualifies
the teacher to discriminate between good and poor
stories. In the treatment of the story the essential
topics are laid out upon the basis of this controlling
idea or motive. The leading aims and carefully
worded questions point toward this central truth.
The side lights and attendant episodes are arranged
with reference to it like the scenes in a drama. The
effort to get at the central truth and the related ideas
is a sifting-out process, a mode of assimilating and
mastering the story more thorough-going than the
mere memorizing of the facts and words for the purpose
of narration. The thought-getting self-activity
and common-sense logic which are involved in this
mode of assimilating a story are good for both pupils
and teacher.</p>

<p>The mastery of a story needed by an oral teacher
implies abundance of resource in illustrative device
and explanation. When children fail to grasp an
idea, it is necessary to fall back upon some familiar<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 21]</span>
object or experience not mentioned in the book.
Emergencies arise which tax the teacher's ingenuity
to the utmost. Even the children will raise queries
that baffle his wit. In preparing a story for the
classroom it is necessary to see it from many sides,
to foresee these problems and difficulties. Oftentimes
the collateral knowledge derived from history
or geography or from similar episodes in other stories
will suggest the solution.</p>

<p>It is a favorite maxim of college teachers and of
those who deal mostly with adults or older pupils,
that if a person knows a thing he can teach it.
Leaving out of account the numerous cases of those
who are well posted in their subjects, but cannot
teach, it is well to note the scope, variety, and thoroughness
of knowledge necessary to a good teacher
to handle it skilfully with younger children. Besides
the thorough knowledge of the subject which scholars
have demanded, it requires an equally clear knowledge
of the mental resources of children, the language
which they can understand, the things which
attract their interest and attention, and the ways of
holding the attention of a group of children of different
capacities, temper, and disposition. Any dogmatic
professor who thinks he can teach the story of
"Cinderella" or Andersen's "Five Peas in the Pod,"
because he has a full knowledge of the facts of the
story, should make trial of his skill upon a class of
twenty children in the first grade. We suggest, how<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 22]</span>ever,
that he do it quietly, without inviting in his
friends to witness his triumph.</p>

<p>No, the mastery of the subject needed for an effective
handling of it in oral work is different and is
greater than they have yet dreamed of who think
that mere objective knowledge is all that is needed
by a teacher. The application of knowledge to life
is generally difficult, more taxing by far than the
mere acquisition of facts and principles. But the
use of one's knowledge in the work of instructing
young children, in getting them to acquire and assimilate
it, is perhaps the most difficult of all forms of
the application of knowledge. It is difficult because
it is so complex. To think clearly and accurately on
some topic for one's single self is not easy, but
to get twenty children of varying capacities and
weaknesses, with their stumbling, acquisitive, flaring
minds, to keep step along one clear line of thought
is a piece of daring enterprise.</p>

<p>The mastery of the story, therefore, for successful
oral work, must be detailed, comprehensive, many-sided,
and adapted to the fluttering thoughts of childhood.</p>

<p>3. The chief instrument through which the teacher
communicates the story is oral speech, and this he
needs to wield with discriminating skill and power.
Preachers and lecturers, when called upon to talk to
children, nearly always talk over their heads, using
language not appropriate and comprehensible to<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 23]</span>
children. Those accustomed to deal with little folks
are quickly sensitive to this amateur awkwardness.
Young teachers just out of the higher schools make
the same blunder. They are also inclined to think
that fluency and verbosity are a sign of power. But
such false tinsel makes no impression upon children
except confusion of thought. Children require
simple, direct words, clearly defined in thought and
grounded upon common experience and conviction.
Facts and realities should stand behind the words of
a teacher. What he seeks to marshal before children
is people and things. Words should serve as
photographs of objects; instantaneous views of experiences.
In some social and diplomatic circles words
are said to conceal thought, but this kind of verbal
diplomacy has no place in schools.</p>

<p>It is an interesting question how far the language
and style of the authors should be preserved by the
narrator. It would be an error to forbid the exact
use of the author's words and an equal error to
require it. It seems reasonable to say that the
teacher should become absorbed in the author's style
and mode of presenting the story. This will lead to
a close approximation to the author's words, without
any slavish imitation. In the midst of oral presentation
and discussion it would be impossible to hold
strictly to the original. The teacher's own language
and conception of the story will press in to simplify
and clarify the meaning. No one holds strictly to a<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 24]</span>
literary style in telling a story. Conversational ideas
and original momentary impulses of thought demand
their own forms of utterance. And yet it is well to
appropriate the style and expression of the writer so
as to accustom the children to the best forms. A
few very apt and forcible sentences will be found in
any good author which the teacher will naturally
employ.</p>

<p>But the teacher must have freedom. When he
has once thoroughly appropriated the story he must
give vent to his own spontaneity and power. Later,
when the children come to read these stories, they
will enjoy them in their full literary form.</p>

<p>4. The power of clear and interesting presentation
of a story is one of the chief professional acquisitions
of a good primary teacher. It involves many things
besides language, including liveliness of manner,
gesture, facial expression, action, dramatic impersonation,
skill in blackboard illustration, good humor
and tact in working with children, a strong imagination,
and a real appreciation for the literature adapted
to children.</p>

<p>Perhaps the fundamental need is simplicity and
clearness of thought and language combined with a
pleasing and attractive manner. Vague and incomprehensible
thoughts and ideas are all out of place.
The teacher should be strict with himself in this
matter, and while reading and mastering the story,
should use compulsion upon himself to arrive at an<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 25]</span>
unmistakable clearness of thought. The objects,
buildings, palaces, woods, caves, animals, persons,
and places should be sharply imaged by the imagination;
the feelings and passions of the actors should
be keenly realized. Often a vague and uncertain
conception needs to be scanned, the passage reread,
and the notion framed into clearness. In describing
the palace of the sleeping beauty, begirt with woods,
the sentinels standing statuelike at the portal, the
lords and ladies at their employments, the teacher
should think out the entrance way, hall, rooms, and
persons of the palace so clearly that his thought and
language will not stumble over uncertainties. Transparent
clearness and directness of thought are the
result of effort and circumspection. They are well
worth the pains required to gain them. A teacher
who thinks clearly will generate clear habits of
thought in children.</p>

<p>The power of interesting narrative and description
is not easily explained. It is a thing not readily
analyzed into its elements. Perhaps the best way to
find out what it is may be discovered by reading the
great story-tellers, such as Macaulay, Irving, Kingsley,
De Foe, Hawthorne, Homer, Plutarch, Scott,
and Dickens. Novelists like George Eliot, Victor
Hugo, Cooper, Scott, and Dickens, possess
this secret also, and even some of the historians,
as Herodotus, Fiske, Green, Parkman, Motley, and
others. It is not so important that a teacher should<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 26]</span>
give a cold analysis of their qualities as that he
should fall insensibly into the vivid and realistic style
of the best story-tellers. One who has read Pyle's
Robin Hood stories until they are familiar will, to
a considerable extent, appropriate his fertile and
happy Old-English style, the sturdy English spirit of
bold Robin, his playful humor, and his apt utterance
of homely truths.</p>

<p>There are certain qualities that stand out prominently
in the good story-tellers. They are simple
and concrete in their descriptions, they deal very
little in general, vague statements or abstractions,
they hold closely to the persons of the story in the
midst of interesting surroundings, they are profuse
in the use of distinct figures of speech, appealing to
the fancy or imagination. They often have a humorous
vein which gives infinite enjoyment and spreads
a happy charity throughout the world.</p>

<p>The art of graphic illustration on the blackboard
is in almost constant demand in oral work. Even
rude and untechnical sketches by teachers who have
no acquired skill in artistic drawing are of the greatest
value in giving a quick and accurate perception
of places, buildings, persons, and surrounding conditions
of a story or action. The map of Crusoe's
island, the drawings to represent his tent, cave, boat,
country residence, fortifications, dress, utensils, and
battles are natural and simple modes of realizing
clearly his labors and adventures. They save much<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 27]</span>
verbal description and circumlocution. The teacher
needs to acquire absolute boldness and freedom in
using such illustrative devices. The children will,
of course, catch this spirit, as they are by nature
inclined to use drawing as a mode of expression.</p>

<p>A similar freedom in the teacher is necessary in
the use of bodily action, gesture, and facial expression
in story-telling. The teacher needs to become natural,
childlike, and mobile in these things; for children
are naturally much given to such demonstrations
in the expression of their thought. Little girls of
three and four years in the home, when free from
self-consciousness, are marvellously and delightfully
expressive by means of eyes, gestures, hands, and
arms and whole bodily attitudes. Why should not
this naive expressiveness be gently fostered in the
school? Indeed it is, and in many schools the little
ones are as happy and whole-souled and spontaneous
in their modes of expression as we have suggested.</p>

<p>Dramatization, if cultivated, extends a teacher's
gamut of expressiveness. Our inability or slowness
to respond to this suggestion is a sign of a certain narrowness
or cramp in our culture and training. In Normal
schools where young teachers are trained in the art
of reading, the dramatic instinct should be strongly
developed. The power to other one's self in dramatic
action, to assume and impersonate a variety of
characters, is a real expression and enlargement of
the personality. It demands sympathy and feeling as<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 28]</span>
well as intellectual insight. The study and reading
of the great dramatists, the seeing of good plays,
amateur efforts in this direction, the frequent oral
reading of Shakespeare, Dickens, and other dramatists
and novelists will cultivate and enlarge the
teacher's power in this worthy and wholesome art.</p>

<p>The use of good pictures is also an important
means of adding to the beauty and clearness of
stories. The pictures of Indian life in "Hiawatha," the
illustrated editions of "Robinson Crusoe," the copies
of ancient works of art in some editions of the Greek
myths, Howard Pyle's illustrated "Robin Hood," and
other books of this character add greatly to the vividness
of ideas. Such pictures should be handled with
care, not distributed promiscuously among the children
while the lesson is going on. The teacher needs
to study a picture, and discuss it intelligently with the
children, asking questions which bring out its representative
qualities.</p>

<p>It is evident the skilful oral presentation of a story
calls out no small degree of clear knowledge, force
of language, illustrative device, dramatic instinct, and
a freedom and versatility of action both mental and
physical.</p>

<p>5. A clear outline of leading points in a story is a
source of strength to the teacher and the basis later
of good reproductive work by the children. The
short stories in the first grade hardly need a formal
outline, and even in second grade the sequence of<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 29]</span>
ideas in a story is often so simple and easy that outlines
of leading topics may not be needed. But in
third and fourth grade it is well in the preliminary
study and mastery of a story to divide it up into
clearly marked segments, with a distinctive title for
each division. It is difficult to get teachers to do this
kind of close logical work, and still more difficult to
have them remember it in the midst of oral presentation
and discussion. If the main points of the story
as thus outlined are placed upon the blackboard as
the narrative advances, it keeps in mind a clear survey
of the whole and serves as the best basis for the
children's reproduction of the story. It compels
both teacher and pupils to keep to a close logical
connection of ideas and a sifting out of the story to
get at the main points. Without these well-constructed
outlines the memory of the story is apt to
fall into uncertainty and confusion, and the children's
reproduction becomes fragmentary and disorderly.
Experience shows that teachers are prone to be loose
and careless in bringing their stories into such a well-ordered
series of distinct topics. It is really a sign
of a thoughtful, logical, and judicious mastery of a
subject to have thrown it thus into its prominent
points of narration. Oral work often fails of effectiveness
and thoroughness, because of these careless
habits of teachers. Such an outline, when put into
the children's regular note-books, serves as the best
basis for later surveys and reviews.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 30]</span></p>

<p>6. The oral narration and presentation of stories
has a curious way of being turned into <i>development
lessons</i>, in which the teacher deals in questions and
problematic situations and the children work out
many of the facts and incidents of the story by a
series of guesses and inferences. These are well
known as development lessons, and they are capable
of exhibiting the highest forms of excellence in teaching
or the most drivelling waste of time. The subject
is a hard one to handle, but it needs a clear and
simple elucidation as much as any problem in the
teaching profession. Generally speaking it is better
for young teachers not to launch out recklessly upon
the full tide of development instruction. It is better
to learn the handling of the craft on quieter waters.
Development work needs to be well charted. The
varying winds and currents, storms and calms, need
to be studied and experienced before one may become
a good ship's master. Let young teachers first
acquire power in clear, simple, direct narration and
description, using apt and forcible language and
holding to a clear-cut line of thought. This is no
slight task, and when once mastered and fixed in
habit becomes the foundation of a wider freedom and
skill in development exercises. The works of the
great story-tellers furnish excellent models of this
sort of skill, and teachers may follow closely in the
lines struck out by Scott or Hawthorne in narrating
a story.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 31]</span></p>

<p>A book story cannot do otherwise than simply
narrate; it cannot develop, set problems and questions
and have children to find solutions and answers.
It must tell the facts and answer the questions. But
in oral narration there is room not only for all the
skill of the story-writer, but also the added force of
voice, personality, lively manner, gesture, action, and
close adaptation to the immediate needs of children
and subject. This is enough to command the undivided
effort of the young teacher at first, without
entering the stormy waters and shifting currents of
pure development work.</p>

<p>Yet the spirited teacher will not go far in narrating
a story without a tendency to ask questions to intensify
the children's thought, or to quicken the discussion
of interesting points. Even if the teachers or
parents are but reading a good story from a book,
it is most natural, at times, to ask questions about
the meaning of certain new words, or geographical
locations, or probabilities in the working out of the
story. These are the simple beginnings of development
work, and produce greater thoughtfulness,
keener perceptions of the facts, and a better absorption
of the story into a child's previous knowledge.</p>

<p>A sharp limitation of development work is also
found in the circumstance that a large share of the
facts in a story cannot by any sort of ingenuity be
developed. They form the necessary basis for later
development questions.  Even many of the facts<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 32]</span>
which might be developed by a skilful teacher are
better told directly, because of the difficulty and
time-devouring nature of the process. There may
be a few central problems in every story, which, after
the necessary facts and conditions have been plainly
told, can be thoroughly sifted out by questions, answers,
and discussions. But to work out all the little
details of a story by question and surmise, to get the
crude, unbaked opinions of all the members of a class
upon every episode and fact in a story, is a pitiful
caricature of good instruction.</p>

<p>The purpose of good development work is to get
children to go deeper into the meaning of a story, to
realize its situations more keenly, and to acquire
habits of thoughtfulness, self-reliant judgment, and
inventiveness in solving difficulties. These results,
and they are among the chiefest set for the educator,
cannot be accomplished by mere narration and description.
Their superior excellence and worth are
the prize of that superior skill which first-class development
work demands.</p>

<p>With these preliminary remarks, criticisms, and
limitations in mind, we may inquire what are the essentials
of good development work in oral lessons.</p>

<p>(1) Determine what parts of a story are capable of
development; what facts must be clearly present to
the mind before questions can be put and inferences
derived. In a problem in arithmetic we first state
the known facts, the conditions upon which a solu<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 33]</span>tion
can be based, and then put a question whose
answer is to be gained by a proper conjunction and
inference from these facts. The same thing is true
in reasoning upon the facts in a story.</p>

<p>(2) In placing a topic before children it is always
advisable to touch up the knowledge already possessed
by the children, or any parts of their previous
experience which have strong interpretative ideas for
the new lesson. At this point apt questions which
probe quickly into their <i>previous knowledge and
experience</i> are at a premium. The teacher needs
to have considered beforehand in what particulars
the children's home surroundings and peculiar circumstances
may furnish the desired knowledge. The
form of the questions may also receive close attention.
For these words must provoke definite thought.
They should have hooks on them which quickly drag
experience into light.</p>

<p>(3) In order to give direction to the children's
thoughts on the story's line of progress, <i>interesting
aims</i> should be set up. These aims, without anticipating
precise results, must guide the children
towards the desired ends and turning-points in the
story. The mind should be kept in suspense as to
the outcome, and the thoughts should centre and
play about these clearly projected aims. Such aims,
floating constantly in the van, are the objective
points, towards which the energy of thought is
directed. Every good story-teller keeps such aims<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 34]</span>
expressly or tacitly in view. Novelists and dramatists
hinge the interest of readers or spectators
upon this curiosity which is kept acutely sensitive
about results. Such an aim should be simple and
concrete, not vague or abstract, or general. It may
be put in the form of a question or statement or
suggestion. It will be a good share of the teacher's
work in the preparation of the lesson to pick out and
word these aims which centre upon the leading
topics of the lesson. For it is not enough to have
an aim at the beginning of a story, every chapter
or separate part of the story should have its aim.
For aims are what stimulate effort and keep up an
attentive interest.</p>

<p>(4) Self-activity and thoughtfulness in working
out problems find their best opportunity in development
work. The book, in narrating a story, cannot
set problems, or, if it does, it forthwith assumes the
task of solving them. But in the oral development
of a story the essential facts and conditions may be
clearly presented and the solution of the difficulties,
as in arithmetic, left largely to the ingenuity and
reasoning power of the children. In the story of
Hiawatha's boat-building the problem may be set to
the children as to what materials he will use in the
construction of the canoe, how the parts were put
together, and how he might decorate it. Not that
the children will give the whole solution, but they
can contribute much to it. In "Robinson Crusoe"<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 35]</span>
many such problems arise. How shall he conceal
his cave and house from possible enemies? Where
can he store his powder to keep it from the lightning
and from dampness? In fact, nearly every step in
Crusoe's interesting career is such a problem or difficulty
to battle with. In Kingsley's "Greek Heroes"
and other renderings of the Greek myths, the heroes
are young men who have shrewdness, courage, and
strength to overcome difficulties. To put these difficulties
before children in such a way that they by
their own thinking may anticipate, in part at least,
the proper solutions, is one of the chief merits of
development work. The story of Ulysses is a series
of shrewd contrivances to master difficulties or to
avoid misfortunes, so that his name has become a
synonym for shrewdness. The story itself, therefore,
furnishes prime opportunities to develop resourcefulness.
How shall he escape from the enraged Polyphemos
in the cave? His invention of the wooden
horse before Troy; his escape from the sirens; his
battle with the suitors and others. The story of
Aladdin has such interesting inventions, and even
the fairy tales and fables have many turns of shrewdness
and device where the children's wits may
be stimulated. The turning-points and centres of
interest in all such stories are the true wrestling-grounds
of thought. To put them point-blank before
children in continuous narrative, without question
or discussion, is not the way to produce thoughtful<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 36]</span>ness
and inventive power. Merely reading or telling
stories to children without comment is entertaining,
but not educative in the better sense. Children will
have plenty of chances at home and in the school
library to read and hear stories, but it is the business
of the school to teach them how to think as they
read, to produce a habit of foreseeing, reviewing,
comparing, and judging. The serious defect of
much of young people's reading, from ten years on,
is its superficial, transitory character. It lacks depth,
strength, and permanency. It is not many stories
that can be orally treated in this thorough-going way,
but enough to give the right idea, and to cultivate
habit and taste for more thoughtful study.</p>

<p>For skilled teachers, therefore, development lessons,
within certain limits, constitute a most important
phase of oral instruction. It has been sometimes
assumed that a child acquires greater self-reliance
and a stronger exercise in self-activity by learning
his lesson by himself from a book. This is probably
true in much of the arithmetic, where he works out
the solution of problems unaided; but in history and
literature the book work is chiefly memory work, and
oftentimes becomes of such parrot-like character
as to be almost destitute of higher educative qualities.
It is advisable, therefore, to strengthen the
educative value of story work by giving it, through
oral instruction, this problem-solving character, this
thought-stimulating, self-reliant attitude of mind.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 37]</span></p>

<p>7. When the teacher has shown his best skill in
presenting and discussing a section of a story, it then
devolves upon the children to show their knowledge
and grasp of the subject by reproducing it. The
task of getting this well done requires, perhaps, as
much skill and force of character as all previous
work of oral instruction. Obstacles are met with at
once. It is dull work to go back over the same thing
again, and the children soon get tired of it. They
want something new and more exciting, and press
for the rest of the story. Many children are at first
deficient in power of attention and in language, so
that their efforts at reproduction are clumsy and poor.
The interest is weak, the attention of the children
scattering, and the class is apt to go to pieces under
the strain of such dull work. This is an emergency
where a teacher needs both skill and force of character.
(What a comfort it is to a writer to have such
a platitude as this to fall back upon, when he gets
a teacher into a place where nothing but his own
devices can save him.)</p>

<p>There are, however, some hopeful considerations
which may encourage a teacher whose feet are not
already too deep in the bog of discouragement.</p>

<p>Children enjoy the retelling of good stories with
which they are familiar. They will do it at home,
even if they are not very proficient at it in school.
In every class there are some talkative children who
are always willing to make an effort. Again, it is<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 38]</span>
not always difficult to interest boys and girls in doing
a thing that requires skill and power, such as memory,
attentiveness, and mastery of correct language. The
force of the teacher's influence and authority is worth
something in setting up high standards of proficiency.
Indeed, children respect a teacher who makes rigorous
demands upon them. The retelling of stories
is, after all, no harder nor duller than the reciting of
a lesson learned out of a book.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the whole effectiveness of oral
work depends upon the success of these oral reproductions.
If children know that the teacher is in
earnest they will be more attentive, so as to be
able to fulfil the requirement. Such a reproduction
reveals at once a child's correct or incorrect grasp
of the subject, and in either case the teacher knows
what to do next. Errors and misconceptions can be
corrected and such explanations or additional facts
given as will clarify the subject.</p>

<p>In such reproductions it is praiseworthy to help
the children as little as possible, to throw them back
upon their own power as much as possible. If the
teacher constantly relieves them with suggestive questions,
they lean more and more upon her direction
and lose all self-reliant power of continuous narrative.
No, let the teacher keep a prudent silence, let
her seal her lips, if necessary, in order to teach boys
and girls to stand on their own power of thought.</p>

<p>Under this sort of discipline, kindly but rigorous,<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 39]</span>
children will gradually acquire confidence in manner,
variety and choice of language, in short, the ability to
grasp clearly, hold firmly, and express accurately the
ideas which are presented to them.</p>

<p>The whole purpose of this sort of instruction is not
so much to see how skilfully a teacher can present a
lesson (though that is a fine art) as to determine how
well a boy or girl can master or express knowledge,
can learn to think and speak for himself.</p>

<p>8. Some teachers despair of treating stories orally
in large classes of primary children. The task of
holding together such wriggling varieties of mental
force and mental inertia is great. Some children are
quick and excitable, others are unresponsive and dull.
Some are timid and sensitive, others bold and demonstrative.
Some are talkative and irrepressible, others
silent or listless.</p>

<p>It is interesting to consider the function and value
of a good child's story to fit in to such varying needs
and personalities. If the purpose of the primary
school is simply to keep children busy at some kind
of orderly work, there are other tamer employments
than stories. But if the idea is to put children's
minds and bodies into healthy, vigorous action, it
would be difficult to find a more suitable instrument
than a fitting story.</p>

<p>But a good primary teacher knows better than to
establish brusque and fixed standards of uniform
success for all children. It will take much time and<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 40]</span>
patience to get anything like good oral responses
from some children. Like budding flowers some
unfold their leaves and petals much quicker at the
touch of sunshine than others. But the sun does not
stop shining because all do not come out at once.
The crudest efforts of little children must be received
with kindness and encouragement. The power of
reproducing thought and language is very slowly
acquired by many children. They are timidly self-conscious,
distrustful of their own powers, and have
not learned to throw themselves with confidence upon
the good-will of their teachers. It may take months
with some children to overcome these obstacles, and
to bring them to a confident use of their powers, but
it is the highest delight of a teacher to reach this
result.</p>

<p>Some children, on the other hand, are so talkative
and impulsive that they will monopolize the time of
the class to no good purpose. Their enthusiasm
requires tempering and their soberer thought strengthening.</p>

<p>Another difficulty lies in the necessary effort to get
correct English, to gradually mould the language of
children into correct forms. The perverse habits of
children, the influence of home and playground, the
inveterate preference for slang and crude, crass
expressions, and their sensitive pride against unusual
refinements of speech, make the cultivation of good
English an uphill task. But roads must be laid out<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 41]</span>
through this wilderness of hills and valleys, stumps
and brush. And these roads must be gradually
worked down into smooth highways of travel. It is
pioneer toil, requiring the steady use of axe and
mattock and spade.</p>

<p>There is no kind of school training where good English
can be cultivated to better advantage, where the
power of correct, independent, well-articulated speech
can be so well strengthened as in oral story. It is
in the close contact of this work that the teacher is
dealing directly with the original stock of experiences,
ideas, and words of every child, and with these as
instruments of acquisition, helping him to get a
spirited introduction to the world of ideas in books
and literature.</p>

<p>It is here that we can get a glimpse of that vast
work which the elementary schools of the country
are doing in the way of Americanizing the children
of various nationalities and in giving them not only
a common language, but a common body of ideas
rooted in the earliest experiences of childhood and
already laying hold of many of the richest treasures
of American history and of the world's literature.</p>

<p>9. As children advance from the first year into the
second and third years the character of the oral story-telling
gradually changes. Children should acquire
more power of attention, greater command of language
and ability to grasp and hold at one telling
a larger section of a story. The stories themselves<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 42]</span>
become more complex, the questions and problems
set by the teacher more difficult. The necessity for
sharp, logical outlines of leading topics increases as
one advances in the grades. Older children can
be held more rigidly to common standards of excellence
in thought and language. In this, however,
the teacher should always remember that children
differ greatly in their natural powers of expression,
and that a forcing process will not be so successful
as a stimulating and encouraging attitude in the
teacher.</p>

<p>10. The good oral treatment of most stories leads
the children to much activity in material constructions.
Where the minds of children are brought to
a healthy activity their bodies and physical energies
are pretty sure to be called into play to work out the
suggested lines of thought. "Robinson Crusoe" invariably
leads the children to a multitude of building
and making enterprises, such as moulding vessels in
clay, constructing the barricade around his tent and
cave, the making of chairs and tables, etc.</p>

<p>We have already noticed the readiness of children
to make blackboard or other drawings of interesting
objects in a story, or to cut them out with scissors
from paper. This effort to experience the realities
of life more directly by making objects of common
utility and necessity is a characteristic and powerful
tendency of childhood. It is commonly seen in
children about the house, when, for example, they<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 43]</span>
must have wagons, wheelbarrows, tools, or a set of
garden implements with which to imitate the employments
of their elders. Parkman and others often
speak of the constant practice of little Indian boys
with bow and arrows.</p>

<p>Our purpose here is not to discuss this matter at
length, but simply to notice its prominent place in
connection with the oral lesson in story. The intense
interest awakened in stories leads quickly to these
efforts at construction. What shall the teacher do
with this powerful tendency of children to carry over
these ideas into the field of practical constructive
labor? To the thinker this tendency is perhaps
the surest proof of the value of the story. It does
not stop with words nor ideas. It pushes far into the
region of voluntary, physical, and mental labor and
application of knowledge.</p>

<p>The teacher who will make good use of this enterprising
constructive desire of children must know definitely
about tools, boards, shops, various industries,
and technical trades, the special materials, inventions,
and devices of artisans in the common occupations,
such as farming, gardening, blacksmithing, the carpenter
shop, the baker, the quarry, the brick kiln, etc.</p>

<p>It will not be strange if many teachers recoil, at
first glance, from this leap into industrial life. It
suggests that the schoolhouse must become a big
machine shop, agricultural station, etc. The trouble
is, of course, that teachers do not feel themselves<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 44]</span>
qualified in these things. They know almost as
little as the children about such matters, and have
much less inclination to know more.</p>

<p>But our modern education is taking a decided turn
in this direction, and with good reason. The close
acquaintance of our teachers with the common occupations
of life, with their materials, tools, machines,
constructions, and skill would supply them with a rich
collection of practical, concrete, illustrative knowledge
of the greatest use in instructing children. It
is impossible to mention anything which would be
of more service to them in the details of instruction.
The advantages to the children of such teaching, re-enforced
by this concrete detail of common life, are
so numerous and important as to deserve a special
effort. The benefit to teachers would quickly more
than recompense them for the labor involved. By
occasional visits of observation in shops, fields, stores,
and factories, by assisting children in their constructive
efforts, the teacher will acquire knowledge,
strength, and confidence for such work. The unfamiliarity
of teachers with these everyday industrial
matters, and their feeling of helplessness as regards
things not in the usual routine of school, are the real
hindrances to be overcome.</p>

<p>There are other subjects in the school course, like
home geography and the early lessons in nature
study, which deal more directly than stories with
these practical forms of industrial life and construc<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 45]</span>tive
activity. They will also demand and cultivate an
increasing knowledge of this practical phase of life
and education. The lessons in oral story-telling
stand thus closely linked with progressive experimental
knowledge in other studies.</p>

<p>A brief retrospect and summary of the requirements
necessary as a basis of good oral treatment of
stories will impress us with the skill and resourcefulness
needed by the teacher.</p>

<p>1. First-hand experience with the realities of life.</p>

<p>2. Intimate knowledge and sympathy with child
life.</p>

<p>3. The many-sided mastery of the story for teaching
purposes.</p>

<p>4. Skill in the use of simple, apt, and forcible
language.</p>

<p>5. Power of narrative and description, together
with various forms of graphic illustration, dramatic
action, etc.</p>

<p>6. Clear and simple outline of leading topics.</p>

<p>7. Acquired power in the use of development
methods, including question, problem, discussion,
aims, and the training of children to self-activity and
thoughtfulness.</p>

<p>8. The successful oral reproduction of stories by
the children.</p>

<p>9. Tact in the handling of large classes, with
children of differing temperament and capacity, and
the encouragement of timid children.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 46]</span></p>

<p>10. Changing character of oral work in advancing
grades.</p>

<p>11. The need of insight and ability to supervise
constructive activities.</p>

<p>These things include a wide range of clear knowledge
and confident skill and resource. Teachers
need first of all to cultivate resourcefulness in the use
of their own knowledge and experience, and to add to
both of these as rapidly as circumstances permit.</p>

<p>The mere reading of stories to children by the
teacher, at odd times, on Friday afternoons or on
special occasions, is also of much value as a means of
interesting children in a wide range of good books.
It is a source of entertainment and culture, which,
when judiciously and skilfully employed, adds much
to the educative power of the school.</p>

<h3>FAIRY TALES</h3>

<p>Young children, as we all know, are delighted with
stories, and in the first grade they are still in this
story-loving period. A good story is the best medium
through which to convey ideas and also to approach
the difficulties of learning to read. Such a story,
Wilmann says, is a pedagogical treasure. By many
thinkers and primary teachers the fairy stories have
been adopted as best suited to the wants of the little
folk just emerging from the home. A series of fairy
tales was selected by Ziller, one of the leading Herbartians,
as a centre for the school work of the first
year. These stories have long held a large place in
the home culture of children, especially of the more
cultivated class. Now it is claimed that what is good
for the few whose parents may be cultured and sympathetic,
may be good enough for the children of the
common people and of the poor. Moreover, stories
that have made the fireside more joyous and blessed
may perchance bring vivacity and happiness into
schoolrooms. The home and the school are coming
closer together. It is even said that well-trained,<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 48]</span>
sympathetic primary teachers may better tell and
impress these stories than overworked mothers and
busy fathers. If these literary treasures are left for
the homes to discover and use, the majority of children
will know little or nothing of them. Many
schools in this country have been using them in the
first grade in recent years with a pleasing effect.</p>

<p>But what virtue lies concealed in these fairy myths
for the children of our practical and sensible age?
Why should we draw from fountains whose sources
are back in the prehistoric and even barbarous past?
To many people it appears as a curious anachronism
to nourish little children in the first decade of this
new century upon food that was prepared in the
tents of wandering tribes in early European history.
What are the merits of these stories for children just
entering upon scholastic pursuits? They are known
to be generally attractive to children of this age, but
many sober-minded people distrust them. Are they
really meat and drink for the little ones? And not
only so, but the choicest meat and drink, the best
food upon which to nourish their unfolding minds?</p>

<p>Fairy tales are charged with misleading children
by falsifying the truth of things. And, indeed, they
pay little heed to certain natural laws that practical
people of good sense always respect. A child, however,
is not so humdrum practical as these serious
truth-lovers. A little girl talks to her doll as if it
had real ears. She and her little brother make tea<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 49]</span>cups
and saucers out of acorns with no apparent
compunctions of conscience. They follow Cinderella
to the ball in a pumpkin chariot, transformed by
magic wand, with even greater interest than we read
of a presidential ball. A child may turn the common
laws of physical nature inside out and not be a
whit the worse for it. Its imagination can people
a pea-pod with little heroes aching for a chance in
the big world, or it can put tender personality into
the trunk and branches of the little pine tree in the
forest. There are no space limits that a child's fancy
will not spring over in a twinkling. It can ride from
star to star on a broomstick, or glide over peaceful
waters in a fairy boat drawn by graceful swans.
Without suggestion from mother or teacher, children
put life and personality into their playthings. Their
spontaneous delights are in this playful exercise of
the fancy, in masquerading under the guise of a
soldier, bear, horse, or bird. The fairy tale is the
poetry of children's inner impulse and feeling; their
sparkling eyes and absorbed interest show how fitting
is the contact between these childlike creations of the
poet and their own budding thoughts.</p>

<p>In discussing the qualities requisite in a fairy story
to make it a pedagogical treasure, Wilmann says:<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
"When it is laid down as a first and indispensable
requirement that a story be genuinely childlike, the
demand sounds less rigorous than it really is. It is<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 50]</span>
easier to feel than to describe the qualities which lend
to a story the true childlike spirit. It is not simplicity
alone. A simple story that can be understood
by a child is not on that account childlike. The
simplicity must be the ingenuousness of the child.
Close to this lies the abyss of silliness into which
so many children's stories tumble. A simple story
may be manufactured, but the quality of true simplicity
will not be breathed into it unless one can draw
from the deeper springs of poetic invention. It is
not enough that the externals of the story, such
as situation and action, have this character, but the
sensibilities and motives of the actors must be ingenuous
and childlike; they should reflect the child's
own feeling, wish, and effort. But it is not necessary
on this account that the persons of the story be
children. Indeed the king, prince, and princess, if
they only speak and act like children, are much
nearer the child's comprehension than any of the
children paraded in a manufactured story, designed
for the 'industrious youth.' For just as real poetry
so the real child's story lies beyond reality in the
field of fancy. With all its plainness of thought and
action, the genuine child's story knows how to take
hold of the child's fancy and set its wings in motion.
And what a meaning has fancy for the soul of the
child as compared with that of the adult. For us
the activity of fancy only sketches arabesques, as
it were, around the sharply defined pictures of reality.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 51]</span>
The child thinks and lives in such arabesques, and
it is only gradually that increasing experience writes
among these arabesques the firmer outlines of things.
The child's thoughts float about playfully and unsteadily,
but the fairy tale is even lighter winged
than they. It overtakes these fleeting summer birds
and wafts them together without brushing the dust
from their wings.</p>

<p>"But fostering the activity of fancy in children is
a means, not an end. It is necessary to enter the
field of fancy because the way to the child's heart
leads through the fancy. The effect upon the heart
of the child is the second mark and proof of the genuine
child's story. We are not advocates of the so-called
moral stories which are so short-winded as to
stop frequently and rest upon some moral commonplace.
Platitudes and moral maxims are not designed
to develop a moral taste in the minds of
young children, for they appeal to the understanding
and will of the pupil and presuppose what must
be first built up and established. True moral training
is rather calculated to awaken in the child judgments
of right and wrong, of good and evil (on
simple illustrative examples). Not the impression
left by a moralizing discourse is the germ of a love
of the good and right, but rather the child's judgment
springing from its own conviction. 'That was
good.' 'What a mean thing!'</p>

<p>"Those narratives have a moral force which intro<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 52]</span>duce
persons and acts that are simple and transparent
enough to let the moral light shine through,
that possess sufficient life to lend warmth and vigor
to moral judgments. No attempt to cover up or
pass over what is bad, nor to paint it in extravagant
colors. For the bad develops the judgment no less
than the good. It remains only to have a care that
a child's interest inclines toward the good, the just,
and the right."</p>

<p>Wilmann summarizes the essentials of a good story,
and then discusses the fairy tales as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"There are then five requirements to be made of
a real child's story: Let it be truly childlike, that is,
both simple and full of fancy; let it form morals
in the sense that it introduces persons and matters
which, while simple and lively, call out a moral judgment
of approval or disapproval; let it be instructive
and lead to thoughtful discussions of society and
nature; let it be of permanent value, inviting perpetually
to a reperusal; let it be a connected whole,
so as to work a deeper influence and become the
source of a many-sided interest.</p>

<p>"The child's story which, on the basis of the aforenamed
principles, can be made the starting-point for
all others, is Grimm's fairy tale of folk lore. We are
now called upon to show that the folk-lore fairy tale
answers to the foregoing requirements, and in this
we shall see many a ray of light cast back upon
these requirements themselves.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 53]</span></p>

<p>"Is the German fairy tale childlike? full of simplicity
as well as of fancy? A deeply poetic saying
of Jacob Grimm may teach us the answer. 'There
runs through these poetic fairy tales the same deep
vein of purity by reason of which children seem to
us so wonderful and blessed. They have, as it were,
the same pale-blue, clear, and lustrous eyes which
can grow no more although the other members are
still delicate and weak and unserviceable to the uses
of earth.' Klaiber quotes this passage in his 'Das
M&auml;rchen und die Kindliche Phantasie,' and says
with truth and beauty, 'Yes; when we look into the
trusting eyes of a child, in which none of the world's
deceit is to be read as yet, when we see how these
eyes brighten and gleam at a beautiful fairy tale, as
if they were looking out into a great, wide, beautiful
wonder-world, then we feel something of the deep
connection of the fairy story with the childish soul.'
We will bring forward one more passage from a little
treatise, showing depth and warmth of feeling, which
stealthily takes away from the doubters their scruples
about the justification of the fairy tale. 'It is strange
how well the fairy tale and the child's soul mutually
understand each other. It is as if they had been
together from the very beginning and had grown up
together. As a rule the child only deals with that
part of real life which concerns itself and children of
its age. Whatever lies beyond this is distant, strange,
unintelligible. Under the leading of the fairy tale,<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 54]</span>
however, it permits itself to be borne over hill and
valley, over land and sea, through sun and moon
and stars, even to the end of the world, and everything
is so near, so familiar, so close to its reach, as
if they had been everywhere before, just as if obscure
pictures within had all at once become wonderfully
distinct. And the fairies all, and the king's sons,
and the other distinguished personages, whom it
learns to know through the fairy tale,&mdash;they are as
natural and intelligible as if the child had moved its
life long in the highest circles, and had had princes
and princesses for its daily playmates. In a word,
the world of the fairy tale is the child's world, for
it is the world of fancy.'</p>

<p>"For this reason children live and move in fairyland,
whether the story be told by the mother or by
the teacher in the primary school. What attention
as the story proceeds! What anxiousness when any
danger threatens the hero, be he king's son or a
wheat-straw! What grief, even to tears, when a wrong
is practised upon some innocent creature! And far
from it that the joy in the fairy tale decrease when
it is told or discussed over again. Then comes the
pleasure of representation&mdash;bringing the story upon
the stage. Though a child has but to represent a
flower in the meadow, the little face is transfigured
with the highest joy.</p>

<p>"But the childish joy of fairy tales passes away;
not so the inner experiences which it has brought<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 55]</span>
with it. I am not affirming too much when I say
that he who, as a child, has never listened with joy
to the murmuring and rustling of the fresh fountain
of fairyland, will have no ear and no understanding
for many a deep stream of German poetry. It is,
after all, the modest fountain of fairy song which,
flowing and uniting with the now noisy, now soft and
gently flowing, current of folk song, and with the
deep and earnest stream of tradition, which has
poured such a refreshing current over German poetry,
out of which our most excellent Uhland has drawn
so many a heart-strengthening draught.</p>

<p>"The spirit of the people finds expression in fairy
tale as in tradition and song, and if we were only
working to lift and strengthen the national impulse,
a moral-educative instruction would have to turn
again and again to these creations of the people.
What was asserted as a general truth in regard to
classical products, that they are a bond between large
and small, old and young, is true of national stories
and songs more than of anything else. They are at
once a bond between the different classes, a national
treasure, which belongs alike to rich and poor, high
and low. The common school then has the least right
of all to put the fairy tale aside, now that few women
versed in fairy lore, such as those to whom Grimm
listened, are left.</p>

<p>"But does the fairy tale come of noble blood?
Does it possess what we called in the case of classics<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 56]</span>
an old title of nobility? If we keep to this figure of
speech, we shall find that the fairy tale is not only
noble, but a very royal child among stories. It has
ruled from olden times, far and wide, over many a
land. Hundreds of years gone, Grimm's fairy stories
lived in the people's heart, and not in Germany alone.
If our little ones listen intently to Aschenputtel,
French children delighted in Cindrillon, the Italian
in Cenerentola, the Polish in Kopcinszic. The fact
that medi&aelig;val story-books contain Grimm's tales is
not remarkable, when we reflect that traits and characteristics
of the fairy tale reach back beyond the
Christian period; that Frau Holle is Hulda, or Frigg,
the heathen goddess; that 'Wishing-cap,' 'Little
Lame-leg,' and 'Table Cover Thyself,' etc., are made
up out of the attributes of German gods. Finally,
such things as 'The Sleeping Beauty,' which is the
earth in winter sleep, that the prince of summer
wakes with kisses in springtime, point back to the
period of primitive Indo-German myth.</p>

<p>"But in addition to the requirement of classical
nobility, has the fairy story also the moral tone which
we required of the genuine child's story? Does the
fairy story make for morals? To be sure it introduces
to an ideal realm of simple moral relations.
The good and bad are sharply separated. The wrong
holds for a time its supremacy, but the final victory
is with the good. And with what vigor the judgment
of good and evil, of right and wrong, is produced.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 57]</span>
We meet touching pictures, especially of good-will,
of faithfulness, characteristic and full of life. Think
only of the typical interchange of words between
Lenchen and Fundevogel. Said Lenchen, 'Leave
me not and I will never leave thee.' Said Fundevogel,
'Now and nevermore.' We are reminded of
the Bible words of the faithful Ruth, 'Whither thou
goest I will go; where thou lodgest I will lodge;
where thou diest I will die and there will I be
buried.'</p>

<p>"Important for the life of children is the rigor with
which the fairy tale punishes disobedience and falsehood.
Think of the suggestive legendary story of
the child which was visited again and again with misfortune
because of its obstinacy, till its final confession
of guilt brings full pardon. It is everywhere a Christian
thread which runs through so many fairy stories.
It is love for the rejected, oppressed, and abandoned.
Whatever is loaded with burdens and troubles receives
the palm, and the first becomes the last.</p>

<p>"The fairy story fulfils the first three requirements
for a true child's story. It is childlike, of
lasting value, and fosters moral ideas. As to unity
it will suffice for children of six years (for this is, in
our opinion, the age at which it exerts its moral
force) that the stories be told in the same spirit,
although they do not form one connected narrative.
If a good selection of fairy tales according to their
inner connection is made, so that frequent references<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 58]</span>
and connections can be found, the requirement of
unity will be satisfied.</p>

<p>"The fairy tale seems to satisfy least of all the
demand that the true child's story must be instructive,
and serve as a starting-point for interesting
practical discussion. The fairy story seems too airy
and dreamy for this, and it might appear pedantry
to load it with instruction. But one will not be
guilty of this mistake if one simply follows up the
ideas which the story suggests. When the story of
a chicken, a fox, or a swan is told it is fully in harmony
with the childish thought to inquire into the
habits of these animals. When the king is mentioned
it is natural to say that we have a king, to ask where
he lives, etc. Just because the fairy tale sinks deep
and holds a firm and undivided attention, it is possible
to direct the suggested thoughts hither or
thither without losing the pleasure they create.
If one keeps this aim in mind, instructive material
is abundant. The fairy tale introduces various employments
and callings, from the king to the farmer,
tailor, and shoemaker. Many passages in life, such
as betrothal, marriage, and burial, are presented.
Labors in the house, yard, and field, and numerous
animals, plants, and inanimate things are touched
upon. For the observation of animals and for the
relation between them and children, it is fortunate
that the fairy tale presents them as talking and feeling.
Thereby the interest in real animals is in<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 59]</span>creased
and heartlessness banished. How could a
child put to the torture an animal which is an old
friend in fairy story?</p>

<p>"I need only suggest in this place how the fairy
story furnishes material for exercises in oral language,
for the division of words into syllables and letters,
and how the beginnings of writing, drawing, number,
and manual exercises may be drawn from the same
source.</p>

<p>"From the suggestions just made the following
conclusions at least may be reasonably drawn. A
sufficient counterpoise to the fantastical nature of
the fairy tale can be given in a manner simple and
childlike, if the objects and relations involved in the
narratives are brought clearly before the senses and
discussed so that instruction about common objects
and home surroundings is begun."</p>

<p>In speaking of Shakespeare's early training in
literature, Charles Kingsley says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I said there was a literary art before Shakespeare&mdash;an
art more simple, more childlike, more
girlish, as it were, and therefore all the more adapted
for young minds, but also an art most vigorous and
pure in point of style: thoroughly fitted to give its
readers the first elements of taste, which must lie at
the root of even the most complex &aelig;sthetics.</p>

<p>"The old fairy superstition, the old legends and
ballads, the old chronicles of feudal war and chivalry,
the earlier moralities and mysteries and tragi<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 60]</span>comic
attempts&mdash;these were the roots of his poetic
tree&mdash;they must be the roots of any literary education
which can teach us to appreciate him. These
fed Shakespeare's youth; why should they not feed
our children's? Why indeed? That inborn delight
of the young in all that is marvellous and fantastic&mdash;has
that a merely evil root? No surely! It is a
most pure part of their spiritual nature; a part of
'the heaven which lies about us in our infancy';
angel-wings with which the free child leaps the
prison-walls of sense and custom, and the drudgery
of earthly life."</p>

<p>Felix Adler says:<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> "But how shall we handle
these <i>M&auml;rchen</i> and what method shall we employ
in putting them to account for our special purpose?
I have a few thoughts on this subject, which I shall
venture to submit in the form of counsels.</p>

<p>"My <i>first counsel</i> is: Tell the story; do not give it
to the child to read. There is an obvious practical
reason for this. Children are able to benefit by
hearing fairy tales before they can read. But that
is not the only reason. It is the childhood of the
race, as we have seen, that speaks in the fairy story
of the child of to-day. It is the voice of an ancient
far-off past that echoes from the lips of the storyteller.
The words 'once upon a time' open up a
vague retrospect into the past, and the child gets
its first indistinct notions of history in this way. The<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 61]</span>
stories embody the tradition of the childhood of mankind.
They have on this account an authority all
their own, not, indeed, that of literal truth, but one
derived from their being types of certain feelings
and longings which belong to childhood as such.
The child, as it listens to the <i>M&auml;rchen</i>, looks up with
wide-opened eyes to the face of the person who tells
the story, and thrills responsive as the touch of the
earlier life of the race thus falls upon its own. Such an
effect, of course, cannot be produced by cold type.
Tradition is a living thing and should use the living
voice for its vehicle.</p>

<p>"My <i>second counsel</i> is also of a practical nature,
and I make bold to say quite essential to the successful
use of the stories. Do not take the moral
plum out of the fairy-tale pudding, but let the child
enjoy it as a whole. Do not make the story taper
toward a single point, the moral point. You will
squeeze all the juice out of it if you try. Do not
subordinate the purely fanciful and naturalistic elements
of the story, such as the love of mystery, the
passion for roving, the sense of fellowship with the
animal world, in order to fix attention solely on
the moral element. On the contrary, you will gain
the best moral effect by proceeding in exactly the
opposite way. Treat the moral element as an incident,
emphasize it indeed, but incidentally. Pluck
it as a wayside flower. How often does it happen
that, having set out on a journey with a distinct<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 62]</span>
object in mind, something occurs on the way which
we had not foreseen, but which in the end leaves the
deepest impression on the mind....</p>

<p>"The value of the fairy tales is that they stimulate
the imagination; that they reflect the unbroken
communion of human life with the life universal, as
in beasts, fishes, trees, flowers, and stars; and that
incidentally, but all the more powerfully on that account,
they quicken the moral sentiments.</p>

<p>"Let us avail ourselves freely of the treasures
which are thus placed at our disposal. Let us welcome
<i>das M&auml;rchen</i> into our primary course of moral
training, that with its gentle bands, woven of 'morning
mist and morning glory,' it may help to lead our
children into bright realms of the ideal."</p>

<p>A selection of fairy stories suited to our first grade
will differ from a similar selection for foreign schools.
There has been a disposition among American
teachers for several years to appropriate the best
of these stories for use in the primary schools. In
different parts of the country skilful primary teachers
have been experimenting successfully with these
materials. There are many schools in which both
teachers and pupils have taken great delight in them.
The effort has been made more particularly with first
grade children, the aim of teachers being to lead captive
the spontaneous interest of children from their first
entrance upon school tasks. Some of the stories used
at the first may seem light and farcical, but experi<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 63]</span>ments
with children are a better test than the preconceived
notions of adults who may have forgotten their
early childhood. The story of the "Four Musicians,"
for example, is a favorite with the children.</p>

<p>At the risk of repetition, and to emphasize some
points of special importance, we will review briefly
the method of oral treatment and the use of the
stories in early primary reading.</p>

<p>The children have no knowledge of reading or perhaps
of letters. The story is told with spirit by the
teacher, no book being used in the class. Question
and interchange of thought between pupil and teacher
will become more frequent and suggestive as the
teacher becomes more skilled and sympathetic in her
treatment of the story. In the early months of school
life the aim is to gain the attention and co&ouml;peration
of children by furnishing abundant food for thought.
Children are required or at least encouraged to narrate
the story or a part of it in the class. They tell it at
school and probably at home, till they become more
and more absorbed in it. Even the backward or
timid child gradually acquires courage and enjoys
narrating the adventures of the peas in the pod or
those of the animals in the "Four Musicians."</p>

<p>The teacher should acquire a vivid and picturesque
style of narrating, persistently weaving into the story,
by query and suggestion, the previous home experiences
of the children. They are only too ready to
bring out these treasures at the call of the teacher.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 64]</span>
Often it is necessary to check their enthusiasm.
There is a need not simply for narrative power, but
for quick insight and judgment, so as to bring their
thoughts into close relation to the incidents. Nowhere
in all the schools is there such a call for close
and motherly sympathy. The gentle compulsion of
kindness is required to inspire the timid ones with
confidence. For some of them are slow to open their
delicate thought and sensibility, even to the sunny
atmosphere of a pleasant school.</p>

<p>A certain amount of drill in reproduction is necessary,
but fortunately the stories have something that
bears repetition with a growing interest. Added to
this is the desire for perfect mastery, and thus the
stories become more dear with familiarity.</p>

<p>Incidentally, there should be emphasis of the instructive
information gathered concerning animals
and plants that are actors in the scenes. The commonest
things of the house, field, and garden acquire
a new and lasting interest. Sometimes the teacher
makes provision in advance of the story for a deeper
interest in the plants and animals that are to appear.
In natural science lessons she may take occasion to
examine the pea blossom, or the animals of the barnyard,
or the squirrel or birds in their cages. When,
a few days later, the story touches one of these animals,
there is a quick response from the children.
This relation between history and natural science
strengthens both.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 65]</span></p>

<p>Many an opportunity should be given for the pupils
to express a warm sympathy for gentle acts of kindness
or unselfishness. The happiness that even a
simple flower may bring to a home is a contagious
example. Kindly treatment of the old and feeble,
and sympathy for the innocent and helpless, spring
into the child's own thought. The fancy, sympathy,
and interest awakened by a good fairy tale make it
a vehicle by which, consciously and unconsciously,
many advantages are borne home to pupils.</p>

<p>Among other things, it opens the door to the reading
lesson; that is, to the beginning efforts in mastering
and using the symbols of written language. The
same story which all have learned to tell, they are
now about to learn to read from the board. One or
two sentences are taken directly from the lips of the
pupils as they recall the story, and the work of mastering
symbols is begun at once with zest. First is
the clear statement of some vivid thought by a child,
then a quick association of this thought with its written
symbols on the board. There is no readier way
of bringing thought and form into firm connection,
that is, of learning to read. Keep the child's fresh
mental judgment and the written form clearly before
his mind till the two are wedded. Let the thought
run back and forth between them till they are one.</p>

<p>After fixing two or three sentences on the board,
attention is directed more closely to the single words,
and a rapid drill upon those in the sentence is fol<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 66]</span>lowed
by a discovery and naming of them in miscellaneous
order. Afterward new sentences are formed
by the teacher out of the same words, written on the
board, and read by the children. They express different,
and perhaps opposite forms of thought, and
should exercise the child's sense and judgment as
well as his memory of words. An energetic, lively,
and successful drill of this kind upon sentences drawn
from stories has been so often witnessed, that its
excellence is no longer a matter of question. These
exercises are a form of mental activity in which children
delight if the teacher's manner is vigorous and
pleasant.</p>

<p>When the mastery of new word-forms as wholes is
fairly complete, the analysis may go a step farther.
Some new word in the lesson may be taken and separated
into its phonic elements, as the word <i>hill</i>, and
new words formed by dropping a letter and prefixing
letters or syllables, as <i>ill</i>, <i>till</i>, <i>until</i>, <i>mill</i>, <i>rill</i>, etc. The
power to construct new words out of old materials
should be cultivated all along the process of learning
to read.</p>

<p>Still other school activities of children stand in
close relation to the fairy tales. They are encouraged
to draw the objects and incidents in which
the story abounds. Though rude and uncouth, the
drawings still often surprise us with their truth and
suggestiveness. The sketches reveal the content of
a child's mind as almost nothing else&mdash;his miscon<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 67]</span>ceptions,
his vague or clearly defined notions. They
also furnish his mental and physical activities an
employment exactly suited to his needs and wishes.</p>

<p>The power to use good English and to express
himself clearly and fittingly is cultivated from the
very first. While this merit is purely incidental, it
is none the less valuable. The persistence with
which bad and uncouth words and phrases are
employed by children in our common school, both in
oral work and in composition, admonishes us to begin
early to eradicate these faults. It seems often as if
intermediate and grammar grades were more faulty
and wretched in their use of English than primary
grades. But there can be no doubt that early and
persistent practice in the best forms of expression,
especially in connection with interesting and appropriate
thought matter, will greatly aid correctness,
fluency, and confidence in speech. There is also
a convincing pedagogical reason why children in the
first primary should be held to the best models of
spoken language. They enter the school better furnished
with oral speech than with a knowledge of
any school study. Their home experiences have
wrought into close association and unity, word and
thing. So intimate and living is the relation between
word and thought or object, that a child really does
not distinguish between them. This is the treasure
with which he enters school, and it should not be
wrapped up in a napkin. It should be unrolled at<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 68]</span>
once and put to service. Oral speech is the capital
with which a child enters the business of education;
let him employ it.</p>

<p>A retrospect upon the various forms of school activity
which spring, in practical work, from the use of
a good fairy story, reveals how many-sided and
inspiriting are its influences. Starting out with a
rich content of thought peculiarly germane to childish
interests, it calls for a full employment of the language
resources already possessed by the children.
In the effort to picture out, with pencil or chalk, his
conceptions of the story, a child exercises his fanciful
and creative wit, as well as the muscles of arms and
eyes. A good story always finds its setting in the
midst of nature or society, and touches up with a
simple, homely, but poetic charm the commonest
verities of human experience. The appeal to the
sensibility and moral judgment of pupils is direct and
spontaneous, because of the interests and sympathies
that are inherent in persons, and touch directly the
childish fancy. And, lastly, the irrepressible traditional
demand that children shall learn to read, is
fairly and honestly met and satisfied.</p>

<p>It is not claimed that fairy tales involve the sum
total of primary instruction, but they are an illustration
of how rich will be the fruitage of our educational
effort if we consider first the highest needs and
interests of children, and allow the formal arts to
drop into their proper subordination. "The best is<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 69]</span>
good enough for children," and when we select the
best, the wide-reaching connections which are established
between studies carry us a long step toward
the now much-bruited correlation and concentration
of studies.</p>

<h3>THE FABLES</h3>

<p>No group of stories has a more assured place in
the literature for children than the &AElig;sop's "Fables."
Some of the commonest have been expanded into
little stories which are presented orally to children in
the first school year, as "The Lion and the Mouse,"
"The Ants and the Grasshoppers," "The Dog and his
Shadow," and others. They are so simple and direct
that they are used alongside the fairy tales for the
earliest instruction of children.</p>

<p>As soon as children have acquired the rudiments of
reading the &AElig;sop's "Fables" are commonly used in
the second and third school year as a reading book,
and all the early reading books are partly made up
from this material.</p>

<p>If we inquire into the qualities of these stories
which have given them such a universal acceptance,
we shall find that they contain in a simple, transparent
form a good share of the world's wisdom. More
recent researches indicate that they originated in
India, and reached Europe through Persia and Arabia,
being ascribed to &AElig;sop. This indicates that like
most early literature of lasting worth, they are products
of the folk-mind rather than of a single writer,
and it is the opinion of Adler that they express the
ripened wisdom of the people under the forms of
Oriental despotism. The sad and hopeless submission
to a stronger power expressed by some of the<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 71]</span>
fables, it is claimed, unfits them for use in our freer
life to-day.</p>

<p>There are certain points in which their attractiveness
to children is clearly manifest. The actors in
the stories are usually animals, and the ready interest
and sympathy of children for talking animals
are at once appealed to. In all the early myths
and fairy tales, human life seems to merge into that
of the animals, as in "Hiawatha," and the fables
likewise are a marked expression of this childlike
tendency.</p>

<p>Adler says: "The question may be asked why
fables are so popular with boys. I should say because
schoolboy society reproduces in miniature, to
a certain extent, the social conditions which are reflected
in the fables. Among unregenerate schoolboys
there often exists a kind of despotism, not the
less degrading because petty. The strong are pitted
against the weak&mdash;witness the fagging system in
English schools&mdash;and their mutual antagonism produces
in both the characteristic vices which we have
noted above." A literature which clearly pictures
these relations so that they can be seen objectively
by the children may be of the greatest social service
in education.</p>

<p>Adler says further: "The psychological study of
schoolboy society has been only begun, but even what
lies on the surface will, I think, bear out this remark.
Now it has become one of the commonplaces of<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 72]</span>
educational literature that the individual of to-day
must pass through the same stages of evolution as
the human race as a whole. But it should not be
forgotten that the advance of civilization depends on
two conditions: first, that the course of evolution be
accelerated, that the time allowed to the successive
stages be shortened; and, secondly, that the unworthy
and degrading elements which entered into the process
of evolution in the past, and at the time were
inseparable from it, be now eliminated. Thus the
fairy tales which correspond to the myth-making
epoch in human history must be purged of the dross
of superstition which still adheres to them, and the
fables which correspond to the age of primitive
despotisms must be cleansed of the immoral elements
they still embody."<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>The peculiar form of moral teaching in the "Fables"
suits them especially to children. A single trait of
conduct, like greediness or selfishness, is sharply
outlined in the story and its results made plain. "We
have seen nothing finer in teaching than the building
up of these little stories in conversational lessons&mdash;first
to illustrate some mental or moral trait; then to
detach the idea from its story picture, and find illustrations
for it in some other act or incident. And
nothing can be more gratifying as a result, than,
through the transparency of childish hearts, to watch
the growth of right conduct from the impulses derived<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 73]</span>
from the teaching; and so laying the foundations of
future rightness of character."<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>The moral ideas inculcated by the fables are usually
of a practical, worldly-wisdom sort, not high ideals of
moral quality, not virtue for its own sake, but varied
examples of the results of rashness and folly. This
is, perhaps, one reason why they are so well suited
to the immature moral judgments of children.</p>

<p>Adler says: "Often when a child has committed
some fault, it is useful to refer by name to the fable
that fits it. As, when a boy has made room in his
seat for another, and the other crowds him out, the
mere mention of the fable of the porcupine is a
telling rebuke; or the fable of the hawk and the
pigeons may be called to mind when a boy has
been guilty of mean excuses. On the same principle
that angry children are sometimes taken before a
mirror to show them how ugly they look, the fable
is a kind of mirror for the vices of the young."
Again: "The peculiar value of the fables is that
they are instantaneous photographs which reproduce,
as it were, in a single flash of light, some one
aspect of human nature, and which, excluding everything
else, permit the attention to be entirely fixed
on that one."</p>

<p>But the value of the fable reaches far beyond
childhood. The frequency with which it is cited in
nearly all the forms of literature, and its aptness<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 74]</span>
to express the real meaning of many episodes in
real life, in politics and social events, in peace and
war, show the universality of the truth it embodies.
A story which engraves a truth, as it were with a
diamond point, upon a child's mind, a truth which
will swiftly interpret many events in his later life,
deserves to take a high place among educative influences.</p>

<h3>"ROBINSON CRUSOE"</h3>

<p>In selecting suitable literature for children of the
second grade, we follow in the steps of a number
of distinguished writers and teachers and choose an
English classic&mdash;"Robinson Crusoe." Rousseau gave
this book his unqualified approval, and said that it
would be the first, and, for a time, the only book
that &Eacute;mile should read. The Herbartians have been
using it a number of years, while many American
teachers have employed it for oral work in second
grade, in a short school edition. In one sense, the
book needs no introduction, as it has found its way
into every nook and corner of the world. Originally
a story for adults, it has reached all, and illustrated
Christmas editions, designed even for children from
three years and upward, are abundant. To the
youth of all lands, it has been, to say the least, a
source of delight, but it has been regarded as a
book for the family and home. What would happen
should the schoolmaster lay his hand on this
treasure and desecrate it to school purposes! We<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 76]</span>
desire to test this classic work on the side of its
pedagogical value and its adaptation to the uses of
regular instruction. If it is really unrivalled as a
piece of children's literature, perhaps it has also
no equal for school purposes.</p>

<p>In making the transition from the fairy tale to
"Robinson Crusoe," an interesting difference or contrast
may be noticed. Wilmann says:<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> "'Crusoe' is
at once simple, and plain, and fanciful; to be sure,
in the latter case, entirely different from the fairy
tale. In the fairy story the fancy seldom pushes
rudely against the boundaries of the real world.
But otherwise in 'Crusoe.' Here it is the practical
fancy that is aroused, if this expression appear not
contradictory. What is Crusoe to do now? How can
he help himself? What means can he invent? Many
of the proposals of the children will have to be rejected.
The inexorable 'not possible' shoves a bolt
before the door. The imagination is compelled to
limit itself to the task of combining and adjusting
real things. The compulsion of things conditions
the progress of the story. 'Thoughts dwell together
easily, but things jostle each other roughly in space.'"</p>

<p>There are other striking differences between "Crusoe"
and the folk-lore stories, but in this contrast we
are now chiefly concerned. After reaching the island,
he is checked and limited at every step by the physical
laws imposed by nature. Struggle and fret as<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 77]</span>
he may against these limits, he becomes at last a
philosopher, and quietly takes up the struggle for
existence under those inexorable conditions. The
child of seven or eight is vaguely acquainted with
many of the simple employments of the household
and of the neighborhood. Crusoe also had a vague
memory of how people in society in different trades
and occupations supply the necessaries and comforts
of life. Even the fairy stories give many hints
of this kind of knowledge, but Robinson Crusoe is
face to face with the sour facts. He is cut off from
help and left to his own resources. The interest in
the story is in seeing how he will shift for himself
and exercise his wits to insure plenty and comfort.
With few tools and on a barbarous coast, he undertakes
what men in society, by mutual exchange and
by division of labor, have much difficulty in performing.
Crusoe becomes a carpenter, a baker and cook,
a hunter, a potter, a fisher, a farmer, a tailor, a boatman,
a stock-raiser, a basket-maker, a shoemaker, a
tanner, a fruit-grower, a mason, a physician. And
not only so, but he grapples with the difficulties of
each trade or occupation in a bungling manner because
of inexperience and lack of skill and exact
knowledge. He is an experimenter and tester
along many lines. The entire absence of helpers
centres the whole interest of this varied struggle in
one person. It is to be remembered that Crusoe is
no genius, but the ordinary boy or man. He has<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 78]</span>
abundant variety of needs such as a child reared
under civilized conditions has learned to feel. The
whole range of activities, usually distributed to various
classes and persons in society, rests now upon his
single shoulders. If he were an expert in all directions,
the task would be easier, but he has only vague
knowledge and scarcely any skill. The child, therefore,
who reads this story, by reason of the slow,
toilsome, and bungling processes of Crusoe in meeting
his needs, becomes aware how difficult and laborious
are the efforts by which the simple, common
needs of all children are supplied.</p>

<p>A reference to the different trades and callings
that Crusoe assumes will show us that he is not dealing
with rare and unusual events, but with the common,
simple employments that lie at the basis of
society in all parts of the world. The carpenter, the
baker, the farmer, the shoemaker, etc., are at work in
every village in every land. Doubtless this is one
reason why the story acquires such a hold in the
most diverse countries. The Arab or the Chinese
boy, the German or American child, finds the story
touching the ordinary facts of his own surroundings.
Though the story finds its setting in a far-away,
lonely island in tropical seas, Crusoe is daily trying
to create the objects and conditions of his old home
in England. But these are the same objects that
surround every child; and therefore, in reading "Robinson
Crusoe," the pupil is making an exhaustive and<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 79]</span>
interesting study of his own home. The presence of
a tropical vegetation and of a strange climate does
not seriously impair this fact. The skill of a great
literary artist appears in his power to create a situation
almost devoid of common comforts and blessings
and then in setting his hero to work to create
them by single-handed effort.</p>

<p>It will hardly be questioned that the study of the
home and home neighborhood by children is one of
the large and prominent problems in education. Out
of their social, economic, and physical environment
children get the most important lessons of life. Not
only does the home furnish a varied fund of information
that enables them to interpret books, and people,
and institutions, as they sooner or later go out into
the world, but all the facts gathered by experience
and reading in distant fields must flow back again to
give deeper meaning to the labors and duties which
surround each citizen in his own home. But society
with its commerce, education, and industries, is an
exceedingly complex affair. The child knows not
where to begin to unravel this endless machinery of
forms and institutions. In a sense he must get away
from or disentangle himself from his surroundings in
order to understand them. There are no complex
conditions surrounding Crusoe, and he takes up the
labors of the common trades in a simple and primitive
manner. Physical and mental effort are demanded
at every step, from Crusoe and from the<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 80]</span>
children. Many of his efforts involve repeated failure,
as in making pottery, in building a boat, while
some things that he undertakes with painful toil
never attain success. The lesson of toil and hardship
connected with the simple industries is one of
great moment to children. Our whole social fabric
is based on these toils, and it is one of the best
results of a sound education to realize the place and
importance of hard work.</p>

<p>It scarcely needs to be pointed out that Crusoe
typifies a long period of man's early history, the age
when men were learning the rudiments of civilization
by taking up the toils of the blacksmith, the agriculturist,
the builder, the domesticator of animals and
plants. Men emerged from barbarism as they slowly
and painfully gained the mastery over the resources
of nature. Crusoe is a sort of universal man, embodying
in his single effort that upward movement
of men which has steadily carried them to the higher
levels of progress. It has been said with some truth
that Robinson Crusoe is a philosophy of history.
But we scarcely need such a high-sounding name.
To the child he is a very concrete, individual man,
with very simple and interesting duties.</p>

<p>In a second point the author of "Robinson Crusoe"
shows himself a literary master. There is an intense
and naive realism in his story. Even if one were so
disposed, it would require a strong effort to break
loose from the feeling that we are in the presence of<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 81]</span>
real experiences. There is a quiet but irresistible
assumption of unvarnished and even disagreeable
fact in the narrative. But it is useless to describe
the style of a book so familiar. Its power over
youthful fancy and feeling has been too often experienced
to be doubted. The vivid interest which the
book awakens is certain to carry home whatever lessons
it may teach with added force. So great is this
influence that boys sometimes imitate the efforts of
Crusoe by making caves, building ovens, and assuming
a style of dress and living that approximates
Crusoe's state. This supplies to teachers a hint of
some value. The story of Crusoe should lead to
excursions into the home neighborhood for the purpose
of a closer examination of the trades and occupations
there represented. An imitation of his labors
may also be encouraged. The effort to mould and
bake vessels from potter's clay, the platting of baskets
from willow withes, the use of tools in making
boxes or tables may be attempted far enough to discover
how lacking in practical ability the children
are. This will certainly teach them greater respect
for manual skill.</p>

<p>From the previous discussion it might appear that
we regard the story of Crusoe as technological and
industrial rather than moral. But it would be a mistake
to suppose that a book is not moral because it is
not perpetually dispensing moral platitudes. Most
men's lives are mainly industrial. The display of<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 82]</span>
moral qualities is only occasional and incidental.
The development of moral character is coincident
with the labors and experiences of life and springs
out of them, being manifested by the spirit with
which one acts toward his fellow-men. But Crusoe
was alone on his island, and there might seem to be
no opportunity to be moral in relation to others. Society,
to be sure, was conspicuous by its absence.
But the intense longing with which he thought of
the home and companionships lost is perhaps the
strongest sentiment in the book. His loneliness
brings out most vividly his true relation to home and
friends.</p>

<p>His early life, till the shipwreck, was that of a wayward
and reckless youth, disobedient to parents and
seemingly without moral scruples. Even during the
first months upon the island there appears little moral
change or betterment. But slowly the bitter experiences
of his lonely life sober him. He finds a Bible,
and a fit of sickness reveals the distresses that may
lie before him. When once the change has set in, it
is rapid and thorough. He becomes devout, he longs
to return to his parents and atone for his faults. A
complete reformation of his moral disposition is
effected. If one will take the pains to read the
original "Robinson Crusoe" he will find it surprisingly
serious and moral in its tone. He devotes
much time to soliloquizing on the distresses of his
condition and upon the causes which have brought<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 83]</span>
him to misery. He diagnoses his case with an
amount of detail that must be tedious to children.
The fact that these parts of the book often leave
little direct impression upon children is proof that
they are chiefly engaged with the adventure and
physical embarrassments of Crusoe. For the present
it is sufficient to observe that the story is deeply and
intensely moral both in its spirit and in the changes
described in "Crusoe."</p>

<p>We are next led to inquire whether the industrial
and moral lessons contained in this story are likely to
be extracted from it by a boy or girl who reads it
alone, without the aid of a teacher. Most young
readers of "Crusoe" are carried along by the interesting
adventure. It is a very surprising and entertaining
story. But children even less than adults are
inclined to go deeper than the surface and draw up
hidden treasures. De Foe's work is a piece of classic
literature. But few people are inclined to get at the
deeper meaning and spirit of a classical masterpiece
unless they go through it in companionship with a
teacher who is gifted to disclose its better meaning.
This is true of any classical product we might mention.
It should be the peculiar function of the
school to cultivate a taste, and an appreciative taste,
for the best literature; not by leaving it to the haphazard
home reading of pupils, but by selecting the
best things adapted to the minds of children and then
employing true teaching skill to bring these treas<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 84]</span>ures
close to the hearts and sympathies of children.
Many young people do not read "Robinson Crusoe" at
all; many others do not appreciate its better phases.
The school will much improve its work by taking
for its own this best of children's stories, and by
extending and deepening the children's appreciation
of a classic.</p>

<p>The story of Robinson Crusoe is made by the
Herbartians the nucleus for the concentration of
studies in the second year. This importance is
given to it on account of its strong moral tone and
because of its universal typical character in man's
development. Without attempting a solution of the
problem of concentration at this juncture, we should
at least observe the relations of this story to the
other studies. Wilmann says: "The everywhere
and nowhere of the fairy tale gives place to the
first geographical limitations. The continents, the
chief countries of Europe, come up, besides a series
of geographical concepts such as island, coast, bay,
river, hill, mountain, sea, etc. The difference in
climate is surprising. Crusoe fears the winter and
prepares for it, but his fear is needless, for no winter
reaches his island." We have already observed its
instructive treatment of the common occupations
which prepare for later geographical study, as well
as for natural science.</p>

<p>Many plants and animals are brought to notice
which would furnish a good beginning for natural<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 85]</span>
science lessons. It is advisable, however, to study
rather those home animals and plants which correspond
best to the tropical products or animals in the
lessons. Tropical fruits, the parrot, and the goat we
often meet at home, but in addition, the sheep, the
ox, the mocking-bird, the woodpecker, our native
fruits and grains, and the fish, turtles, and minerals
of the home, may well be suggested and studied in
science lessons parallel with the life of Crusoe.</p>

<p>Following upon the oral treatment and discussion
of "Robinson Crusoe" the children are easily led to
like efforts at construction, as, for instance, the making
of a raft, the building of the cave and stockade,
the making of chairs and tables, the moulding of jars
and kettles out of clay, the weaving of baskets, the
preparation and cooking of foods, the planting of
grains, the construction of an oven or house, boat
building, and other labors of Crusoe in providing for
his wants.</p>

<p>It is quite customary now in second grade to set
the children to work in these efforts to solve Crusoe's
problems, so that they, by working with actual
materials, may realize more fully the difficulties and
trials to which he was subjected. In close connection
with these constructive efforts are the drawings
of the scenes of the story, such as the shipwreck,
the stockade, the boat, the map of the island, and
some of the later events of the story. A still further
means of giving reality to the events is to dramatize<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 86]</span>
some of the scenes between Friday and Crusoe, and
to dress and equip these and other persons in the
story in fitting manner. The children gladly enter
into such dramatic action. These various forms of
drawing, action, and constructive work are in close
connection with the home studies of industries and
occupations,&mdash;farming, gardening, carpenter and
blacksmith shops, weaving, cooking, bakeries, and excursions
to shops&mdash;which follow the Crusoe story
in the study of home geography in the third grade.</p>

<p>Although the story should be given and discussed
orally, the children should also read it later as a part
of the regular reading exercise of the course.
Instead of suffering from this repetition, their interest
will only be increased. Classical products usually
gain by repetition. The facts are brought out
more clearly and the deeper meaning is perceived.
To have the oral treatment of a story precede its
reading by some weeks or months produces an excellent
effect upon the style of the reading. The
thought being familiar, and the interest strong, the
expression will be vigorous and natural. Children
take a pride in reading a story which they at first
must receive orally for lack of reading power.</p>

<p>The same advantageous drill in the use of good
English accrues to the Crusoe story that was observed
in the fairy tales. There is abundant opportunity
for oral narrative and description.</p>

<p>The use of the pencil and chalk in graphic repre<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 87]</span>sentation
should be encouraged both in teacher and
in pupils. Thus the eye becomes more accurate in
observation and the hand more free and facile in
tracing the outlines of the interesting forms studied.
The use of tools and materials in construction gives
ideas an anchorage, not only in the brain, but even
in the nerves and muscles.</p>

<p>In thus glancing over the field we discover the
same many-sided and intimate relation with other
school studies, as in the previous grade. In fact,
"Crusoe" is the first extended classical masterpiece
which is presented to the children as a whole. Such
parts of the story as are of most pedagogical value
should be simplified and woven together into a continuous
narrative. That part of the story which precedes
the shipwreck may be reduced to a few
paragraphs which bring out clearly his early home
surroundings, his disobedience and the desertion of
his parents, and the voyage which led to his lonely
life upon the island. The period embraced in his
companionless labors and experiences constitutes the
important part for school uses. A few of the more
important episodes following the capture of Friday
and his return home may be briefly told. We deem it
a long step forward to get some of our great classical
masterpieces firmly embedded in the early years of
our school course. It will contribute almost as much
to the culture and stimulation of teachers as of pupils.</p>

<p>The method of handling this narrative before the<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 88]</span>
class will be similar to that of the fairy tales. A
simple and vivid recital of the facts, with frequent
questions and discussions, so as to draw the story
closer to the child's own thought and experience,
should be made by the teacher. Much skill in illustrative
device, in graphic description, in diagram or
drawing, in the appeal to the sense experiences of
the pupils, is in demand. The excursion to places of
interest in the neighborhood suggested by the story
begins to be an important factor of the school exercises.
As children grow older they acquire skill and
confidence in oral narrative, and should be held to
greater independence in oral reproductions.</p>

<p>One of the best school editions of "Robinson
Crusoe" is published by Ginn &amp; Co.</p>

<p>A simple edition for second grade is published by
the Public School Publishing Co.</p>

<p>The teacher should be supplied with one of the
larger, fuller editions of "Robinson Crusoe," like that
of Houghton, Mifflin, &amp; Co., in the Riverside Literature
Series. It furnishes a much fuller detail of
knowledge for the teacher's use. It will also be of
great advantage for classroom use to possess an illustrated
edition like that of George Routledge &amp; Sons.</p>

<p>The full treatment of this story, first in simple,
oral narrative, later by its use as a reading book,
and later still by the child reading the complete
edition for himself in private, illustrates the intensive
concentration of thought and constructive activity<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 89]</span>
upon a great piece of literature as opposed to a loose
and superficial treatment. Such a piece of work
should remain for life a source of deeper thought,
feeling, and experience.</p>

<h3>"HIAWATHA"</h3>

<p>The story of Hiawatha has been much used for
oral treatment in primary grades, and as a basis for
exercises in learning to read. Later the complete
poem has been much read in third, fourth, or fifth
grade as a piece of choice literature.</p>

<p>A story which is growing so rapidly in favor with
primary teachers may explain our effort to determine
its educational value.</p>

<p>That the story begins with the early childhood of
Hiawatha and describes his home and early training
at the feet of Nokomis, is at least one point in its
favor.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">By the shores of Gitche Gumee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the shining Big-Sea-Water,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stood the wigwam of Nokomis,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Daughter of the Moon, Nokomis.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dark behind it rose the forest,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 90]</span><span class="i0">Rose the black and gloomy pine-trees,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rose the firs with cones upon them;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bright before it beat the water,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beat the clear and sunny water,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beat the shining Big-Sea-Water.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There the wrinkled, old Nokomis<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nursed the little Hiawatha,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rocked him in his linden cradle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bedded soft in moss and rushes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Safely bound with reindeer sinews.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The traditions and stories he learned from the lips
of Nokomis will remind children of their own home
life, while his companionship with birds and animals
will touch them in a sympathetic place.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">Then the little Hiawatha<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Learned of every bird its language,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Learned their names and all their secrets,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How they built their nests in Summer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where they hid themselves in Winter,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Talked with them whene'er he met them,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Called them "Hiawatha's Chickens."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The games and exercises of his youth will remind
them of their own sports and introduce them to Indian
life. This home of Hiawatha, and the description of
his childhood, are a happy introduction to the simple
surroundings of Indian life on the shores of the
northern sea.</p>

<p>Primitive Indian modes of life, traditions and myths,
appeal naturally to children, and the whole story has
this setting of early simplicity which adapts it in
many ways to child study. The Indian nature myths,<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 91]</span>
which in themselves are attractive, are here woven
into a connected series by their relation to Hiawatha
in the training of his childhood and in the exploits of
his manhood.</p>

<p>The number of pure fairy tales scattered through
the story adapts it especially for young children,
while the descriptions of home customs, feasts, weddings,
merrymaking, and games, show the happier
side of their life.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">Ye who love a nation's legends,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Speak in tones so plain and childlike,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scarcely can the ear distinguish<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Listen to this Indian Legend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To this song of Hiawatha!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And are lifted up and strengthened;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Listen to this simple story,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To this Song of Hiawatha!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The description of husking time is such a pleasing
scene, while the picture writing of the Indians, their<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 92]</span>
totems and rude drawings, are in harmony with their
traditions and religion.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">On the border of the forest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Underneath the fragrant pine-trees,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And whene'er some lucky maiden<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Found a red ear in the husking,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Found a maize-ear red as blood is,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Nushka!" cried they all together,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Nushka! you shall have a sweetheart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You shall have a handsome husband!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Ugh!" the old men all responded<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From their seats beneath the pine-trees.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">And the Jossakeeds, the Prophets,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Wabenos, the Magicians,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And each figure had its meaning,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each some magic song suggested.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>One of the most striking features of this story is
its setting in nature. More than any other piece of<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 93]</span>
literature now used in the school, it is redolent of
fields and forest.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 94]</span>This
description of primitive man is as complete
an absorption into his natural surroundings as is
possible. His food and clothing, his tents and boats,
his weapons and war gear, are drawn directly from
nature's first supplies, and man, in this case, seems
almost a part of nature, so completely are his
thoughts and activities determined and colored by his
environment. Like the animals, in their protective
coloring, he becomes an undistinguishable part of his
surroundings. His nature myths and superstitions
are but phases and expressions of the contact of his
crude mind with forces and objects in nature. In
this respect there are many interesting suggestions
of similar interpretations among the Norse and
Greek mythologies.</p>

<p>The close and friendly contact of Hiawatha with
trees and animals, his companionship with the
squirrel, the woodpecker, and the beaver, his talking
acquaintance with trees of the forest, with the fishes
in the Big-Sea-Water, and with the masters of the
winds, the storm, and the thunder, make him an interesting
guide for the children among the realms of
nature.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">Ye who love the haunts of nature,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Love the sunshine of the meadow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Love the shadow of the forest,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And the rain-shower and the snow-storm,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>A happy, sympathetic love for the sights and
sounds in nature is a fortunate beginning of nature
lore. The imaginative interpretations are common
to all the early races and in full harmony with the
temper of childhood. Even from the standpoint
of nature study, this early poetic joy in nature descriptions
is profitable. The matter-of-fact, analytic
study of natural science in succeeding years need not
begrudge the children this happiness, this interpretative
play of the imagination, this music of field and
forest. In early childhood, nature and poetry are
one, and as Lowell says, "Let us not go about to
make life duller than it is."</p>

<p>The simplicity and beauty of the language and
figure of speech make many parts of this poem
especially appropriate for children.</p>

</div></div>

<p>The simple music and rhythm of the poetic form
is so delightful to children that they absorb whole
passages into their memory without conscious effort.
The mere re-reading of parts of the poem to little
children under six years will often produce this
happy result. A little girl of three years picked up,
among others, this passage:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Dark behind it rose the forest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rose the black and gloomy pine-trees,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rose the firs with cones upon them;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bright before it beat the water,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beat the clear and sunny water,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beat the shining Big-Sea-Water.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The repetitions of the same or similar passages, so
common throughout the poem, is a successful appeal
to children's favor. It gives the story a sort of
Mother Goose flavor which is delightful.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 97]</span></p>

<p>While the story centres in Hiawatha, it has a
variety of interesting personalities, giving expression
to the striking features of this primitive society.
Hiawatha's loved ones, Minnehaha and old Nokomis,
stand first, and his chosen friends are next.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Pondering much and much contriving<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How the tribes of men might prosper.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In connection with these persons is a most pleasing
series of adventures, bringing to notice those
heroic qualities which children love to witness. The
very strong man, Kwasind, is a fitting companion in
their thoughts to Samson and Hercules; and Chibiabos,</p>

also prove a curious character, something like Proteus
of old.</p>

<p>The character of Hiawatha, as of the benefactor,
of one devoted, with high purpose, to the welfare of
his people, may be regarded as the deeper motive of
the author. It is the thought of ideal good in
Hiawatha which gives tone and meaning to the
whole poem.</p>

</div></div>

<p>The views of geography and history at the beginning
and close of the poem not only give a broad scope
to the story, but have an interesting bearing upon the
study of geography and history in those years of school
which immediately follow.  The narrative reaches<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 99]</span>
from the Vale of Tawasentha in New York, across
the great lakes and shining Big-Sea-Water to Minnehaha
and the Upper Mississippi, and even to the
prairies and the distant Rocky Mountains beyond.
In the summoning of the tribes at the Great Pipe
Stone Quarry there is a broad survey of the Indian
tribes of the United States.</p>

the meaning of this description to the children.</p>

are given.</p>

</div></div>

<p>The story of Hiawatha has been used sufficiently
in primary grades to show how many are its suggestions
for drawing and constructive work. Little
children take delight in drawing the Indian tents,
bows and arrows, pine forests, Indian warriors and
dress, the canoe, the tomahawk, the birds and animals.
The cutting of these forms in paper they
have fully enjoyed.</p>

<p>Pictures of Indian life, collections of arrow-heads,
the peace-pipes, articles of dress, cooking utensils,
wampum, stone hatchets, red pipe-stone ornaments,
or a visit to any collection of Indian relics are desirable
as a part of this instruction. The museums
in cities and expositions are rich in these materials,
and in many private collections are just the desired
objects of study.</p>

<p>It is well known that children love to construct
tents, dress in Indian style, and imitate the mode of<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 101]</span>
life, the hunting, dancing, and sports of Indians.
Teachers have taken advantage of this instinct to
allow them to construct an Indian village on a small
scale, and assume the dress and action of Hiawatha
and his friends, and even to dramatize parts of the
story.</p>

<p>It is only certain selected parts of the "Hiawatha"
that lend themselves best to the oral treatment with
children, and that, at first, not in the poetic form.
In fact, the oral treatment of a story in beautiful
poetic form demands a peculiar method.</p>

<p>For example, in treating the childhood of Hiawatha
as he dwelt with old Nokomis in the tent beside the
sea, the main facts of this episode, or a part of it,
may be talked over by means of description, partly
also by development, question, and answer, and when
these things are clear, let this passage of the poem
be read to the children. The preliminary treatment
and discussion will put the children in possession
of the ideas and pictures by which they can better
appreciate and assimilate the poem. This mode of
introducing children to a poem or literary masterpiece
is not uncommon with children in later years,
at least in the middle grades.</p>

<p>It has been customary to use nearly the whole
poem in fourth or fifth school year for regular reading,
and it is well suited to this purpose. Its use in
primary grades for such oral treatment as we have
described will not interfere with its employment as<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 102]</span>
reading matter later on, but rather increase its value
for that purpose.</p>

<p>The method of handling such a poem as reading
has been discussed in the Special Method in the
Reading of Complete English Classics.</p>

teachers on the use of "Hiawatha" in primary

<h2><span class="smcap">Third Grade Stories</span></h2>


<h3>THE MYTHICAL STORIES</h3>

<p>In the third grade we wish to bring a number of
the mythical stories vividly before the children. The
classical myths which belong to the literature of
Europe are the fund from which to select the best.
Not all, but only a few of the simple and appropriate
stories can be chosen. Only two recitation periods a
week are usually set apart for the oral treatment of
these old myths. But later in the progress of the
reading lessons other similar stories should be treated.
The few recitation periods used for oral work are
rather designed to introduce children to the spirit of
this literature, to get them into the appreciative mind.</p>

<p>This body of ancient myths comes down to us,
sifted out of the early literature of the active-minded
Greeks. They have found their way as a simple and
charming poetry into the national literature of all the
European countries. Is this the material suited to
nine- and ten-year-old children? It will not be questioned
that these myths belong to the best literary
products of Europe, but are they suited to children?</p>

<p>It is evident that some of our best literary judges
have deemed them appropriate. Hawthorne has put<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 104]</span>
them into a form designed especially for the young
folk. Charles Kingsley wrote of the Greek myths
for his children: "Now I love these old Hellens
heartily, and they seem to me like brothers, though
they have all been dead and gone many a hundred
years. They are come to tell you some of their old fairy
tales, which they loved when they were young like
you. For nations begin at first by being children like
you, though they are made up of grown men. They
are children at first like you&mdash;men and women with
children's hearts; frank, and affectionate, and full
of trust, and teachable, loving to see and learn all
the wonders around them; and greedy also, too
often, and passionate and silly, as children are."</p>

<p>Not a few other authors of less note have tried to
turn the classical myths of the old Greek poets into
simple English for the entertainment and instruction
of children. Scarcely any of these stories that have
not appeared in various children's books in recent
years. Taken as a whole, they are a storehouse
of children's literature. The philosopher, Herbart,
looked upon poems of Homer as giving ideal expression
to the boyhood of the race, and the story of
Ulysses was regarded by him as the boy's book,&mdash;the
Greek Robinson Crusoe. For the child of nine
years he thought it the most suitable story.</p>

<p>Kingsley says in his Introduction: "Now you must
not think of the Greeks in this book as learned men,
living in great cities, such as they were afterwards,<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 105]</span>
when they wrought all their beautiful works, but as
country people, living on farms and in walled villages,
in a simple, hard-working way; so that the greatest
kings and heroes cooked their own meals and thought
it no shame, and made their own ships and weapons,
and fed and harnessed their own horses. So that a
man was honored among them, not because he happened
to be rich, but according to his skill and his
strength and courage and the number of things he
could do. For they were but grown-up children,
though they were right noble children too, and it was
with them as it is now at school, the strongest and
cleverest boy, though he be poor, leads all the rest."</p>

<p>In the introduction to the "Wonder Book" we find
the following: "Hawthorne took a vital interest in
child life. He was accustomed to observe his own
children very closely. There are private manuscripts
extant which present exact records of what his young
son and elder daughter said or did from hour to hour,
the father seating himself in their playroom and
patiently noting all that passed. To this habit of
watchful and sympathetic scrutiny we may attribute
in part the remarkable felicity, the fortunate ease of
adaptation to the immature understanding, and the
skilful appeal to the fresh imaginations which characterize
his stories for the young." Hawthorne himself
says: "The author has long been of the opinion
that many of the classical myths were capable of
being rendered into very capital reading for chil<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 106]</span>dren....
No epoch of time can claim a copyright
on these immortal fables. They seem never to have
been made, and so long as man exists they can never
perish; but by their indestructibility itself they are
legitimate subjects, for every age to clothe with its
own garniture of manners and sentiment, and to
imbue with its own morality.... The author has
not always thought it necessary to write downward in
order to meet the comprehension of children. He has
generally suffered the theme to soar, whenever such
was its tendency. Children possess an unestimated
sensibility to whatever is deep or high in imagination
or feeling so long as it is simple likewise. It is only
the artificial and the complex that bewilder them."</p>

<p>A brief analysis of the qualities which render these
myths so attractive will help us to see their value in
the education of children.</p>

<p>The astonishing brightness of fanciful episode and
of pure and clear-cut imagery has an indestructible
charm for children. They can soar into and above
the clouds on the shining wings of Pegasus. With
Eolus they shut up the contrary winds in an ox-hide,
and later let them out to plague the much-suffering
Ulysses. They watch with astonishment as Jason
yokes the fire-breathing oxen and strews the field
with uprooted stumps and stones as he prepares the
soil for the seed of dragon's teeth. Each child
becomes a poet as he recreates the sparkling brightness
of these simple pictures. And when a child<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 107]</span>
has once suffered his fancy to soar to these mountain
heights and ocean depths, it will no longer be possible
to make his life entirely dull and prosaic. He
has caught glimpses of a bright world that will linger
unfading in the uplands of his memory. And while
they are so deep and lofty they are still, as Hawthorne
says, very simple. Some of the most classic
of the old stories are indeed too long for third grade
children; too many persons and too much complexity,
as in the "Tales of Troy." But on the other hand,
many of the most beautiful of the old myths are as
plain and simple to a child as a floating summer
cloud. High in the sky they may be or deep in the
reflection of some lake or spring, but clear and plain
to the thought of a little child. These stories in their
naive simplicity reflect the wonder and surprise with
which a person first beholds grand and touching
scenery, whether it be the oppressive grandeur of
some beetling mountain crag, or the placid quiet of
a moonlit stream. The stories selected for this grade
should be the simplest and best: "The Golden Touch,"
"Perseus," "The Chim&aelig;ra," of Hawthorne, the episodes
of the "Golden Fleece," with others similar.</p>

<p>In one form or another they introduce us to the
company of heroes, or, at least, of great and simple
characters. Deeds of enterprise and manliness or
of unselfishness and generosity are the climax of the
story. To meet danger and hardship or ridicule for
the sake of a high purpose is their underlying<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 108]</span>
thought. Perseus and Jason and Ulysses are all
ambitious to prove their title to superior shrewdness
and courage and self-control. When we get fairly
into the mythical age, we find ourselves among the
heroes, among those striving for mastery and leadership
in great undertakings. Physical prowess and
manly spirit are its chief virtues. And can there
be any question that there is a time in the lives of
children when these ideas fill the horizon of their
thought? Samson and David and Hercules, Bellerophon
and Jason, are a child's natural thoughts or,
at least, they fit the frame of his mind so exactly
that one may say the picture and the frame were
made for each other. The history of most countries
contains such an age of heroes. Tell in Switzerland,
Siegfried in Germany, Bruce in Scotland, Romulus
and Horatius at Rome, Alfred in England, are all
national heroes of the mythical age, whose deeds are
heroic and of public good. The Greek stories are
only a more classic edition of this historical epoch,
and should lead up to a study of these later products
of European literature.</p>

<p>Several forms of moral excellence are objectively
realized or personified in these stories.</p>

<p>As the wise Centaur, after teaching Jason to be
skilful and brave, sent him out into the world, he
said: "Well, go, my son; the throne belongs to thy
father and the gods love justice. But remember, wherever
thou dost wander, to observe these three things:<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 109]</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Relieve the distressed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Respect the aged.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Be true to thy word."<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And many events in Jason's life illustrate the
wisdom of these words. The miraculous pitcher is
one whose fountain of refreshing milk bubbled
always because of a gentle deed of hospitality to
strangers. King Midas, on the other hand, experiences
in most graphic form the punishment which
ought to follow miserly greed, while his humble
penitence brought back his daughter and the homely
comforts of life. Bellerophon is filled with a desire
to perform a noble deed that will relieve the distress
of a whole people. After the exercise of much
patience and self-control he succeeds in his generous
enterprise. Many a lesson of worldly wisdom
and homely virtue is brought out in the story of
Ulysses' varied and adventuresome career.</p>

<p>These myths bring children into lively contact
with European history and geography, as well as
with its modes of life and thought. The early history
of Europe is in all cases shrouded in mist and
legend. But even from this historically impenetrable
past has sprung a literature that has exercised a
profound influence upon the life and growth of the
people. Not that children are conscious of the significance
of these ideas, but being placed in an<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 110]</span>
atmosphere which is full of them, their deeper meaning
gradually unfolds itself. The early myths afford
an interesting approach for children to the history
and geography of important countries. Those countries
they must, sooner or later, make the acquaintance
of both geographically and historically, and
could anything be designed to take stronger hold
upon their imagination and memory than these
charming myths, which were the poetry and religion
of the people once living there?</p>

<p>It is a very simple and primitive state of culture,
whose ships, arms, agriculture, and domestic life are
given us in clear and pleasing pictures. Our own
country is largely lacking in a mythical age. Our
culture sprang, more than half-grown, from the
midst of Europe's choicest nations, and out of institutions
that had been centuries in forming. The
myths of Europe are therefore as truly ours as they
are the treasure of Englishmen, of Germans, or of
Greeks. Again, our own literature, as well as that
of European states, is full of the spirit and suggestion
of the mythical age. Our poets and writers
have drawn much of their imagery from this old
storehouse of thought, and a child will better understand
the works of the present through this contact
with mythical ages.</p>

<p>In method of treatment with school classes, these
stories will admit of a variation from the plan used with
"Robinson Crusoe." One unaccustomed to the reading<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 111]</span>
of such stories would be at a loss for a method of
treatment with children. There is a charm and literary
art in the presentation that may make the
teacher feel unqualified to present them. The children
are not yet sufficiently masters of the printed
symbols of speech to read for themselves. Shall the
teacher simply read the stories to children? We
would suggest first of all, that the teacher, who would
expect to make use of these materials, steep himself
fully in literature of this class, and bring his mind
into familiar acquaintance and sympathy with its characters.
In interpreting classical authors to pupils,
we are justified in requiring of the teacher intimate
knowledge and appreciative sympathy with his author.
Certainly no one will teach these stories well whose
fancy was never touched into airy flights&mdash;who cannot
become a child again and partake of his pleasures.
No condescension is needed, but ascension to
a free and ready flight of fancy. By learning to
drink at these ancient fountains of song and poetry,
the teacher might learn to tell a fairy story for himself.
But doubtless it will be well to mingle oral narrative
and description on the part of the teacher with the
fit reading of choice parts so as to better preserve the
classic beauty and suggestion of the author. Children
are quite old enough now to appreciate beauty of language
and expressive, happy turns of speech. In
the midst of question, suggestion, and discussion between
pupil and teacher, the story should be carried<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 112]</span>
forward, never forgetting to stop at suitable intervals
and get such a reproduction of the story as the little
children are capable of. And indeed they are capable
of much in this direction, for their thoughts are
more nimble, and their power of expression more apt,
oftentimes, than the teacher's own.</p>

<p>We would not favor a simple reading of these
stories for the entertainment of pupils. It should
take more the form of a school exercise, requiring
not only interest and attention, but vigorous effort to
grasp and reproduce the thought. The result should
be a much livelier and deeper insight into the story
than would be secured by a simple reading for amusement
or variety. They should prepare also for an
appreciative reading of other myths in the following
grades.</p>

<p>After all, in two or three recitation periods a week,
extending through a year, it cannot be expected that
children will make the acquaintance of all the literature
that could be properly called the myth of the
heroic age in different countries. All that we may
expect is to enter this paradise of children, to pluck
a few of its choicest flowers, and get such a breath of
their fragrance that there will be a child's desire to
return again and again. The school also should provide
in the succeeding year for an abundance of reading
of myths. The same old stories which they first
learned to enjoy in oral recitations should be read in
books, and still others should be utilized in the regu<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 113]</span>lar
reading classes of the fourth and fifth grades. In
this way the myths of other countries may be brought
in, the story of Tell, of Siegfried, of Alfred, and of
others.</p>

<p>In summarizing the advantages of a systematic
attempt to get this simple classic lore into our
schools, we recall the interest and mental activity
which it arouses, its power to please and satisfy the
creative fancy in children, its fundamental feeling
and instincts, the virtues of bravery, manliness, and
unselfishness, and all this in a form that still further
increases its culture effect upon teacher and pupil.
It should never be forgotten that teacher and pupil
alike are here imbibing lessons and inspirations that
draw them into closer sympathy because the subject
is worthy of both old and young.</p>

<p>In addition to the earlier Greek myths we may mention
the following subjects as suitable for oral treatment:</p>

<p>The story of Ulysses has been much used in schools
with oral presentation, and is one of the best tales for
this purpose in all literature. A somewhat full discussion
of the value of this story for schools is found
in the Special Method in Reading of Complete
English Classics.</p>

<p>The Norse mythology has also received much
attention from teachers who have used the oral mode
of treatment. Several of the best books of Norse
mythology are mentioned in the appended list. Also
the great story of Siegfried.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 114]</span></p>

<p>Some of the old traditional stories in the early history
of Rome, of France, Germany, and England, have
been used for oral narration and reading to children.</p>

<p>The "Seven Little Sisters" and its companion book
"Each and All," and the "Ten Boys on the Road
from Long Ago to Now," by Jane Andrews, published
by Ginn &amp; Co., have been employed extensively for
oral and reading work in the third and fourth years
of school. The "Seven Little Sisters" is valuable in
connection with the beginnings of geography.</p>

<h3>THE BIBLE STORIES</h3>

<p>The stories of early Bible history have been much
used in all European lands, and in America, for the
instruction of children. Among Jews and Christians
everywhere, and even among Mohammedans, these
stories have been extensively used. They include
the simple accounts of the patriarchs, Abraham,
Isaac, Jacob, Joseph and his brethren, Moses, Joshua,
Samson, Samuel, and David. It may be seen at a
glance that no more famous stories than these could
be selected from the history of any country in the
world. They stand pre&euml;minent as graphic descriptions
of the modes of life which prevailed in the early
period of civilized races. The old patriarchs lived in
what is usually called the pastoral age, when men
dwelt in tents and moved about from place to place<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 117]</span>
with their flocks in search of pasture. The patriarch
at the head of the family, and even of a whole tribe,
is the father, ruler, priest, and judge for the little
community over which he presides. In his person
there is a simple union of all the important powers
of the later Hebrew state. The dignity and authority
which centre in the person of Abraham, together
with a marked gravity and strength of character,
lend a distinct grandeur to his personality, so that he
has been recognized in all ages as one of the great
figures in the history of the world; the foremost of
the old patriarchs,&mdash;the father of the faithful. A
similar respect and dignity attaches to all these old
Bible characters, and in the case of Moses, rises to
a supreme height, while in David the warrior, statesman,
and poet are united in one of the most pronounced
and pleasing characters in the world's
history. These old stories are also unparalleled in
the simplicity and transparent clearness with which
the life of the pastoral age is depicted. Human
nature comes out in a series of pictures most striking
and individual, and yet unmistakably true to life and
reality. And yet while this life was so small in its
compass, it is almost wholly free from narrowness
and provincialism. The universal qualities of human
nature, common to men in all ages and countries,
stand out with a clearness which even little children
can grasp. The story of Joseph and his brethren is
probably the finest story that was ever written for<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 118]</span>
children from eight to ten years of age. The characters
involved in this family history are striking and
impressive, and the strength of the family virtues
and affections has never been set forth with greater
simplicity and power.</p>

<p>The heroic qualities which appear in the old Bible
stories, especially in Moses, Samson, and David, would
bear a favorable comparison with the men of the
heroic age in all countries. Strength of character
combined with faith in high ideals, pursued with
unwavering resolution, is a peculiar merit of these
narratives. The heroes of the Hebrew race should
be compared, later on, with the most renowned
heroes of England, Scotland, Germany, and Greece,
and even of America, for they have common qualities
which have like merit as educative materials for the
young.</p>

<p>This early literature of the Bible stories will be
found to contain a large part of the universal thought
of the world, that is, of the masterly ideas which,
because of their superior truth and excellence, have
gradually worked their way as controlling principles
into the life of all modern nations. It need hardly
be said that these stories have a peculiar charm
and attractiveness for children. The simplicity of a
patriarchal age, the strong interest in persons of
heroic quality, the descriptions of early childhood,
the heroic deeds of bold and high-spirited youth,&mdash;these
things command the unfaltering interest of<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 119]</span>
children, and at the same time give their lives a
touch of moral strength and idealism which is of the
highest promise.</p>

<p>The oral treatment of these stories in the third or
fourth year of school is the only mode of bringing
them before the children in their full power, and they
are well adapted to easy oral narrative and discussion.
The language is the genuine, simple, powerful old
English, and the teacher should become thoroughly
saturated with these simple words and modes of
thought. The dramatic element is also not lacking
in many parts, and can be well executed in the classroom.
Many opportunities will be furnished to the
children for drawing pictures illustrating the stories.
Many of the most famous masterpieces of painting
and sculpture represent the persons and scenes of
these tales. The great heroes of Christian art have
exhausted their skill in these representations, which
are now being furnished to the schools by the large
publishing houses. Even the costumes and modes
of life are thus brought home to the children in the
most realistic yet artistic way.</p>

<p>An acquaintance with such early stories of Hebrew
history is an introduction to some of the finest literature
of the English language. First, that dealing with
the Hebrew scriptures themselves, as the books of
Moses, the psalms of David, and second, a number of
the great poems of English masters, as the "Burial
of Moses" and Milton's "Samson Agonistes." In<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 120]</span>
short, we may say that these stories are the key to a
large part of our best English thought.</p>

<p>Adler, in his "Moral Instruction of Children," says:
"The narrative of the Bible is fairly saturated with
the moral spirit; the moral issues are everywhere in
the forefront. Duty, guilt, and its punishment, the
conflict of conscience with inclination, are the leading
themes. The Hebrew people seem to have been
endowed with what may be called 'a moral genius,'
and especially did they emphasize the filial and fraternal
duties to an extent hardly equalled elsewhere.
Now it is precisely these duties that must be impressed
upon young children, and hence the biblical
stories present us with the very material we require.
They cannot, in this respect, be replaced; there is
no other literature in the world that offers what is
equal to them in value for the particular object we
now have in view."</p>

<p>If we could only contemplate the patriarchal stories
as a part of the great literature of the world, on
account of its typical yet realistic portraiture of men
and women, we might use this material as we use the
very best derived from other sources. Mr. Adler
remarks that "this typical quality in Homer's portraiture
has been one secret of its universal impressiveness.
The Homeric outlines are in each case
brilliantly distinct, while they leave to the reader a
certain liberty of private conception, and he can fill
them in to satisfy his own ideal. We may add that<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 121]</span>
this is just as true of the Bible as of Homer. The
biblical narrative, too, depicts a few essential traits of
human nature, and refrains from multiplying minor
traits which might interfere with the main effect.
The Bible, too, draws its figures in outline, and leaves
every age free to fill them in so as to satisfy its own
ideal."</p>

<p>Moreover, their use is not a matter of experiment.
For hundreds of years they have held the first place
in the best homes and schools of Germany, England,
and America, and their educative influence has been
profoundly felt in all Christian nations.</p>

<p>We have several editions of the stories adapted
from the Bible for school use. In the Bible itself
they are not found in the simple, connected form that
makes them available for school use. One of the
best editions for school is that published by Houghton,
Mifflin, &amp; Co., called, "Old Testament Stories in
Scriptural Language." A free and somewhat original
rendering of the stories is given by Baldwin in
his "Old Stories of the East," published by the
American Book Co. Both of these books have been
extensively used in the schools of this country. The
oral treatment of the Bible stories in the schools has
not been common in this country, but it has all the
merits described by us in the chapter on oral instruction.
In fourth and fifth grades these books may
serve well for exercises in reading.</p>

<p>In a great many schools of this country they can<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 122]</span>
be used and are used without giving offence to anybody,
and where this is true, they well deserve recognition
in our school course because of their superior
presentation of some of the great universal ideas of
our civilization.</p>

<h3>STORIES OF ROBIN HOOD</h3>

<p>In the latter part of third grade or beginning of
fourth, the stories of Robin Hood are likely to prove
exhilarating to children.</p>

<p>These stories of the bold, manly, good-natured
outlaw, with his band of trusty men in Sherwood
Forest, have been famous throughout England these
five hundred years, and the stories themselves, and
the ballads accompanying them, are a genuine part
of the treasures of the older English literature.
They have been worked by Howard Pyle into the
stout, hearty English style which is so appropriate
to the rendering of the deeds of this sturdy English
yeoman and his band.</p>

<p>Their careless life and woodland sports under the<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 123]</span>
Greenwood Tree, and their merry adventures and
shooting matches, have been the delight of many
a generation of English children. But even their
woodland sports were a severe and rugged training
in hardy endurance and manly spirit. Pyle says
well in his preface: "For honest purposes manfully
followed and hard knocks courageously endured
must always interest the wholesome boy; while nature
is so closely akin to man in the golden days of
his green youth that tales of the Greenwood, where
the leaves rustle and the birds sing, and all the air
is full of sweet savors of growing things, must ever
have a potent charm for the fresh imagination of
childhood."</p>

<p>One phase of this training, as manifested in the
stories, is not only the ability to take hard knocks
and keep a stiff upper lip, as the old saying goes,
but to master chagrin and anger and endure fun and
gibes at one's own expense; indeed, even with aching
bones and buzzing ears, to join in the merriment
over one's own discomfiture. This is an unusual
accompaniment of even good stories, which makes
them truly wholesome. The fun of the stories also
is of a light and rollicking sort which children should
have a chance to thoroughly enjoy. In fact it is
excellent material upon which to cultivate their early
sense of the comic and humorous. The literature
used in early school years has, unfortunately, too
little of the sportive and laughable, and the Robin<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 124]</span>
Hood adventures will help in no small degree to
remedy this defect.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note, also, that brute strength
is not at a premium, but skill and quick-wittedness.
Not the least attractive and forcible part of Robin
Hood's character is the shrewd-witted versatility and
boldness with which he plays any part which circumstances
require him to assume. His foes are circumvented
by his shrewdness and keen wit even as much
as by his unfailing skill in archery or dexterous
strength in personal contest.</p>

<p>Robin Hood's relation to the British government
was known as that of the outlaw, although the visit
of King Richard to him in Sherwood Forest and his
service under that prince and others gave him a certain
legal status. He has always been regarded as
a popular hero representing the rights of the common
people.</p>

<p>After describing Robin Hood's first adventure
with the foresters and his outlawry, Howard Pyle
says: "But Robin Hood lay hidden in Sherwood
Forest for one year, and in that time there gathered
around him many others like himself, outlawed for
this cause and for that.</p>

<p>"So, in all that year, five score or more good, stout
yeomen joined themselves to him, and chose him to
be their leader and chief. Then they vowed that
even as they themselves had been despoiled they
would despoil their oppressors, whether baron, abbot,<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 125]</span>
knight, or squire, and that from each they would
take that which had been wrung from the poor by
unjust taxes, or land rents, or in wrongful fines; but
to the poor folk they would give a helping hand in
need and trouble, and would return to them that
which had been unjustly taken from them. Besides
this, they swore never to harm a child, nor to wrong
a woman, be she maid, wife, or widow; so that, after
a while, when the people began to find that no harm
was meant to them, but that money or food came in
time of want to many a poor family, they came to
praise Robin and his merry men, and to tell many
tales of him and of his doings in Sherwood Forest,
for they felt him to be one of themselves."</p>

<p>When we consider the stories which tradition has
handed down relative to the exploits of Robin Hood,
the Old-English ballads which celebrate them in
song, the stories of King Richard's visit to him in
Sherwood, and Robin's visit to the court of Eleanor
and King Henry at London town, to share in the
great shooting-match, and the story of Locksley in
Scott's "Ivanhoe"&mdash;we might almost say that
Robin Hood would bear favorable comparison with
any Englishman of his time. At any rate it would
be difficult to find among the kings and great lords
of that age one who had so much regard for justice
and fair dealing among men, to say nothing of his
kindness to the poor and needy.</p>

<p>He stands distinctly for those rights of the com<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 126]</span>mon
people which were constantly violated by the
powerful and influential in that half-barbarous age
of feudalism. It is from this instinct for popular
rights that the body of English liberties has gradually
developed, and it is not strange that Robin
Hood has always been regarded as a hero among
a people who have preserved this instinct for liberty
and justice.</p>

<p>The foresters of Robin Hood's band were lovers
of forest and glade; the song of the bird and fragrance
of wild flowers were sweet to them. In Pyle's
introductory chapter is this description of their retreat
under the Greenwood. "So turning their backs
upon the stream, they plunged into the forest once
more, through which they traced their steps till they
reached the spot where they dwelt in the depths of
the woodland. There had they built huts of bark
and branches of trees, and made couches of sweet
rushes spread over with skins of fallow deer. Here
stood a great oak tree with branches spreading
broadly around, beneath which was a seat of green
moss where Robin Hood was wont to sit at feast
and at merrymaking, with his stout men about him.
Here they found the rest of the band, some of whom
had come in with a brace of fat does. Then they
built great fires, and after the feast was ready they
all sat down, but Robin Hood placed Little John at
his right hand, for he was henceforth to be the
second in the band."<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 127]</span></p>

<p>Little John's bout with the tanner of Blyth is
introduced thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>"One fine day, not long after Little John had left
abiding with the Sheriff and had come back to the
merry Greenwood, Robin Hood and a few chosen
fellows of his band lay upon the soft sward beneath
the Greenwood Tree where they dwelt. The day
was warm and sultry, so that whilst most of the band
were scattered through the forest upon this mission
and upon that, these few stout fellows lay lazily
beneath the shade of the tree, in the soft afternoon,
passing jests among themselves and telling merry
stories, with laughter and mirth.</p>

<p>"All the air was laden with the bitter fragrance of
the May, and all the bosky shades of the woodlands
beyond rang with the sweet song of birds,&mdash;the
throstle-cock, the cuckoo, and the wood-pigeon,&mdash;and
with the song of birds mingled the cool sound
of the gurgling brook that leaped out of the forest
shades, and ran fretting amid its rough gray stones
across the sunlit open glade before the trysting-tree."</p>

<p>This delight in the beauty and music of all nature
about them is a sort of atmosphere which gives tone
to all the stories of this group.</p>

<p>The language in which the stories are narrated is
rich in the quaint and vigorous phrases of Old
English, reminding one of the times of Shakespeare
and before. One could hardly give the children a
better introduction to the riches of our mother tongue.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 128]</span></p>

<p>The description of English customs, the popular
festivities, the booths of the market town, the parade
of feudal lords and retainers, the constraints placed
upon hunting by kings and lords, and the hardships
of the poor are touched upon in significant ways.
The stories give an insight into the English character,
their love of rude sports, their ballad literature,
and their respect for honesty and courage and
shrewdness.</p>

<p>The ballads associated with the Robin Hood
legends are often beautiful and striking expressions
of the English spirit, and have a special charm for
children. They should be read in connection with
the later reading of the stories in the third and
fourth school years.</p>

<p>The bearing of these tales upon early feudal history
and the general literature of that age is of importance.
This is well illustrated in "Ivanhoe" in
the use by Richard of Robin Hood and his archers in
the attack upon Torquilstone, and in various exploits
of the men of the Greenwood when brought in contact
with knights on horseback. There is also a
kinship in these narratives with some of the best
stories and novels of early English history, as Scott's
"Tales of a Grandfather," Kingsley's "Hereward the
Wake," Jane Andrew's "Gilbert the Page," and a
number of Scott's novels.</p>

<p>In the oral treatment of the stories in the third or
fourth school year, the teacher will find her powers<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 129]</span>
of presentation taxed in a peculiar way. The quaint
language and humorous tone, the occasional witty
conceits, will need to be appreciated and enjoyed, and
the mode of presentation suited to the thought. Let
the teacher first of all thoroughly enjoy the stories
and in rendering them to children in the classroom
lose herself in the tone and spirit of the account. It
requires great freedom and flexibility of body and
mind to do this well, but that is what a teacher most
of all needs. The humorous part, especially, will require
a certain unbending of the stiff manners of a
teacher, but no harm is done in this.</p>

<p>The large volume of Robin Hood stories by Pyle
should be in the hands of the teacher, if possible,
although it is an expensive book. It is much fuller
in the special details of the stories needed by the
teacher, though the smaller book is far better adapted
as a reading book for schools.</p>

<p>To illustrate the place which the Robin Hood
legends hold in English history and literature, the
following selections, quoted from Tennyson's "The
Foresters" and one of the old ballads, are given.
They are taken from "English History told by
English Poets," published by The Macmillan Company,
where the passage from "The Foresters" is
given at greater length.</p>

<h4>KING RICHARD IN SHERWOOD FOREST<br /><br />

<span class="smcap">Lord Tennyson</span><br />

<small>(From "The Foresters")</small></h4>

<p>Robin Hood and Maid Marian, Friar Tuck and
George-a-Green, Will Scarlet, Midge the Miller's
Son, Little John, and the rest are legendary characters
loved and sung from the fourteenth century
to modern times. The charm of these light-hearted
highwaymen was felt by Shakespeare himself:
"They say he is already in the forest of Arden, and
a many merry men with him: and there they live like
the old Robin Hood of England; they say many
young gentlemen flock to him every day, and fleet
the time carelessly, as they did in the golden world."&mdash;("As
You Like It," I, <span class="smcap">I.</span>) Tennyson adopts the
tradition that the generous outlaws dwelt in Sherwood
Forest in Cumberlandshire, and that their
leader, Robin Hood, was the banished Earl of Huntingdon.
The plot of the "The Foresters" turns
upon the sudden return of Richard from his Austrian
captivity and the consequent collapse of the intrigues
conducted by his crafty and cruel brother John.</p>

<h4>HOW ROBIN HOOD RESCUED THE WIDOW'S THREE SONS</h4>

<p>Robin Hood and his followers were bandits and
outlaws, but the people loved them because they
defied the hateful forest laws and made light of the
sheriff. The king's officers were responsible for
the maintenance of order, but in these lawless times
they often used their power for their own advantage,
imposing heavy fines and penalties on the poor, and
extorting bribes from the rich. The following is<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 133]</span>

<h2><span class="smcap">Primary Reading through Incidental Exercises
and Games</span></h2>

<h3>BASED ON SCHOOL MOVEMENTS, STUDIES, AND GAMES</h3>


<p>Before entering upon the discussion of the usual
methods of introducing children to the art of reading
we will give a treatment of the incidental opportunities
offered by the other studies, by school movements
and games in primary classes, for introducing
children to the written and printed forms.</p>

<p>It is assumed that the more closely the written or
printed words and sentences are related to the children's
activities, or the more dependent these activities
are made upon a knowledge of the word-forms,
the quicker and more natural will be their mastery.
To put it briefly, the teacher abstains from the use of
oral speech to a considerable extent and substitutes
the written forms of the words on the blackboard in
giving directions, in games, and in treating topics
in literature and science. The following chapter is
taken wholly from the lessons given by Mrs. Lida B.
McMurry in the first grade. Many other similar
lessons were worked out, but these are probably
sufficient to fully illustrate the plan.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 138]</span></p>

<p>The teacher's aim in the beginning reading is to
lead the child to look to the lesson, either word or
sentence or paragraph, to find what it has to say to
him&mdash;to present the lesson in such a way that the
child shall quicken into life in its presence&mdash;shall
reach forward to grasp this much-desired thing. The
attention of the child is centred on the thought; he
grasps the symbols because he must reach, through
them, the thought.</p>

<p>Much of the early reading can be taught in a
purely incidental way&mdash;in the general exercises of
the school and in the literature and nature-study
recitations.</p>


<h3>READING TAUGHT INCIDENTALLY</h3>

<p>(a) <i>In the General Management of the School.</i> The
directions which are at first given to children orally,
<i>e.g.</i>, <i>rise</i>, <i>turn</i>, <i>pass</i>, <i>sit</i>, <i>skip</i>, <i>fly</i>, <i>march</i>, <i>run</i>, <i>walk</i>,
<i>pass to the front</i>, <i>pass to the back</i>, are later written
upon the board. When the children seem to have
become familiar with the written direction, the
order in which the directions are given is sometimes
changed, as a test, <i>e.g.</i>, the following directions
are usually given in this order&mdash;<i>turn</i>, <i>rise</i>, <i>pass</i>.
Instead of writing <i>turn</i> first, the teacher writes <i>pass</i>.
If the children understand, they will rise at once and
pass without waiting to turn.</p>

<p>The names of the children, instead of being spoken,
are often written; in this way the children become<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 139]</span>
familiar with the names of all the children in the
school. The teacher, writing <i>Clarence</i> upon the board,
says, "I would like this boy to erase the boards
to-night." The first time it is written the teacher
speaks the name as she writes it. It may be necessary
to do this several times. The teacher does not
look at Clarence as she writes his name. If he does
not recognize his name after it has appeared repeatedly,
his eyesight may well be tested. If heedlessness
is the cause of the failure, another name is
written at the board, and Clarence loses the opportunity
to do the service. No drill should be given on
these names. The repetition incident to the frequent
calling upon the child is all that is necessary to fix
the name.</p>

<p>The names of the songs and of the poems which
the children are memorizing are written upon the
board as needed. The teacher says, "We will sing
this song this morning." If the children do not
recognize its title as the teacher points to it, she
gives it. After a while the children will recognize
the names of all the songs and the poems which
are in use in the room.</p>

<p>The children become familiar with the written
form of the smaller numbers in this way&mdash;the
number of absent children is reported at each
session and written on the board. On Friday the
teacher records upon the board some facts of the
week, or of the month, which the children learned<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 140]</span>
from their weather charts&mdash;viz., the number of
sunny and the number of cloudy days. The number
of children in each row is ascertained and written at
the board that the monitors may know how many
pairs of scissors, pieces of clay, or pencils to select.</p>

<p>The poems, after being partially committed to
memory, are written upon the board; when the
pupils falter, reference is made to the line in question
as it appears upon the board.</p>

<p>The teacher sometimes writes her morning greeting
or evening farewell at the board&mdash;thus: "Good
morning, children," or, "Good-by for to-day." The
children read silently and respond with, "Good morning,
Miss Eades," or, "Good night, Miss Farr."</p>

<p>Often she communicates facts of interest at the
board. If the pupils are unable to interpret what
she has written, she reads for them, <i>e.g.</i>, the teacher
writes, "We have vacation to-morrow." Quite likely
some child, unable to read at all, will say, "We have
<i>something</i>, but I can't tell what it is." (These same
words will occur again, when needed to express a
thought, and it is a waste of energy to drill upon
them.) When the children have interpreted the
above sentence at the board, the teacher writes, "Do
you know why?" The children read the question
silently and give the answer audibly, and say, "It is
Decoration Day." We too often allow children to
treat a question in their reading as if its end were
reached in the asking. To lead the children to form<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 141]</span>
a habit of answering questions asked in writing or in
print, such questions as the following are, from time
to time, written at the board: "Did you see the rainbow
last night?" "What color was it?" "Did you
see any birds on Saturday?" "What ones?" "Have
you been to the woods?" "What did you find there?"</p>

<p>(b) <i>In Connection with the Literature.</i> The name
of the story which the teacher is about to tell is
placed upon the board. At the first writing the
teacher tells the pupils what it is, if necessary, <i>e.g.</i>,
the teacher says, "We shall have a story about '<i>The
Three Bears</i>,'" pointing to the title upon the board.
The next day she says, "I would like you to tell me
all you can about this story"&mdash;writing its name upon
the board.</p>

<p>In the final reproduction of the story the teacher
assigns topics, <i>e.g.</i>: Chauncey may tell me about
this (writing at the board): <i>Silver-Hair going to
the woods</i>. Eva may tell about this: <i>Silver-Hair
going into the kitchen</i>. Jennie may tell about this:
<i>Silver-Hair going into the sitting room</i>. Willie may
tell about this: <i>Silver-Hair going upstairs</i>. Should
the child go beyond the limited topic, the teacher
points to the board and asks about what he was to
tell.</p>

<p>At the close of each story that can be dramatized,
the teacher assigns at the board the part which each
is to take, thus: After the story of "The Old Woman
and the Pig" is learned, the teacher writes in a col<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 142]</span>umn
each child's name opposite the animal or thing
which he is to represent, in this way.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>Agnes</i>&mdash;the old woman.<br />

<i>Glenn</i>&mdash;the pig.<br />

<i>Sadie</i>&mdash;the dog, etc.</p>
</div>

<p>(c) <i>In Connection with the Nature Study.</i> In the
spring the children are looking for the return of the
birds, the first spring blossoms, and the opening of
the tree buds. The teacher often makes her own discoveries
known through writing, upon the board, <i>e.g.</i>,
"I saw a robin this morning," or "I found a blue
violet yesterday," or "I saw some elm blossoms last
night."</p>

<p>The class, by the aid of the teacher, make a bird,
a flower, and a tree-bud calendar, on which are recorded
the name and date of the first seen of each.
These names are put on the calendars in the presence
of the children, and they frequently "name their
treasures o'er."</p>

<p>The mode of travelling is written beside the name
of each familiar bird as the children make the discoveries,
thus:&mdash;</p>



<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="10" summary="">
<tr><td align='left'>Robin</td><td align='left'>hops.<br />runs.<br />flies.</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td align='left'>Crow</td><td align='left'>walks.<br />flies.</td></tr>
</table></div>


<p>Questions arise during the recitation which the
children will answer later from observation. That
the children may not forget them they are placed
high up on the board where they can be preserved.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 143]</span>
Frequent reference is made to them to see if the
pupils are prepared to answer them. When a question
is answered it is erased, making room for another.</p>


<h3>THE READING RECITATION</h3>

<p>For the early reading, Games, Literature, and
Nature Study may form the basis.</p>

<hr />

<p><b>(I) <i>Games as a Basis for the Reading.</i></b> The child
enters school from a life of play. It is our purpose,
so far as possible, to make use of this natural bent of
the child to insure interest in his reading, as well as
to give him the free exercise, which he needs, of his
muscles. It may be urged as an argument against the
use of the games, that they are too noisy and attract
the attention of the children who are busy at their
seats. Often it would be a good thing for these children
to watch the younger ones at their games. It
would rest them and put them into closer sympathy
with the little ones. In a short time they will not
care so much to watch them. The little children
should be thoughtful of the older ones and move about
as quietly as is possible.</p>

<p>The following are some of the games which we have
used in our primary school. They are given in the
way of suggestion only. They are played at first by
following spoken directions. When the children are
perfectly familiar with the oral direction, the written
direction is gradually substituted. The children do
not stay long enough on one game to become tired of<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 144]</span>
it. Two or three or even more are played at a single
recitation. It is not the plan to drill the pupils upon
the written directions, but by frequent repetitions to
familiarize them with them. The games are most
suitable for the very earliest reading lessons. The
plan for teaching one of them, the first one given
here, will be written out quite fully. The others will
be given with less detail.</p>


<h4>THE RING GAME</h4>

<p><i>Material.</i>&mdash;Six celluloid rings, red, white, blue, yellow,
green, and black. Surcingle rings can be painted
the colors desired.</p>

<p><i>Directions.</i>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Take the red ring, Jennie.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Take the blue ring, Eva.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Take the yellow ring, Wallace.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Take the green ring, Chauncey.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Take the black ring, Gregory.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Take the white ring, Lloyd.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>When the children are ready to hide the rings this
direction is given to the remainder of the class:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Close your eyes.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This to the pupils who hold the rings:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Hide the rings.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>When the children have all the rings hid they announce
it by lightly clapping their hands, upon which<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 145]</span>
the children open their eyes. Directions are then
given to those who did not hide rings, for finding the
rings, <i>e.g.</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Find the red ring.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Find the blue ring, etc.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>No notice is taken of any ring but the one called
for. A limited time is given for the finding of each.
At the close of that time, if the ring is not discovered,
the one who hid it gets it. When the written directions
are first used the whole sentence need not be
put upon the board, <i>e.g.</i>, the teacher need write only&mdash;<i>the
red ring</i>. She says to the child, "find <i>this</i>"&mdash;pointing
to the board; or <i>red</i>, alone, may be written,
in which case the teacher points to the word, saying,
"You may find <i>this ring</i>." There is considerable
rivalry to see who will find the most rings.</p>

<p>When the children seem to know the written directions
perfectly, a test is made of their ability,
actually, to read them; thus, instead of writing,
"<i>Take</i> the red ring," the teacher writes, "<i>Find</i> the
red ring." She writes "Hide the rings," before she
writes, "Close your eyes." If the children recognize
what is written they will set the teacher right.</p>


<h4>BALL AND CORD</h4>

<p><i>Material.</i>&mdash;Small, soft rubber balls with short rubber
cords attached. The cords have a loop for the
finger.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 146]</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ball in right hand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Toss up.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hold.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Toss down.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hold.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Toss to the right.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hold.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Toss to the left.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hold.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ball in left hand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Toss up, etc.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In this and succeeding games it is left to the discretion
of the teacher as to when the written directions
shall be introduced.</p>


<h4>BALL GAME</h4>

<p><i>Material.</i>&mdash;A soft rubber ball.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Form a circle.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Take the ball, Roy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Toss the ball.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Roll the ball.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bounce the ball.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Throw the ball.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Give the ball to Sadie.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In this game one of the children takes the ball to
the circle. Each, as the ball is tossed to him, tosses
it to another. At the direction of the teacher the
game of <i>tossing the ball</i> is changed to one of <i>rolling</i><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 147]</span>
<i>the ball</i>, the pupils squatting on the floor; this in
turn is changed later as the directions indicate.
Care must be taken that all children are treated
alike in this game. The children themselves will
look out for this if properly directed at the outset
of the game.</p>


<h4>HUNTING THE VIOLET</h4>

<p><i>Material.</i>&mdash;Violets scattered about the room.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Find a blue violet, Glenn.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Find a violet bud, Edith.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Find a yellow violet, Lloyd.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Find a violet leaf, Sadie.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Find a white violet, Jennie.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Find a purple violet, Rudolph.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sing to the violets.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Children sing softly:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Oh, violets, pretty violets,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I pray you tell to me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why are you the first flowers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That bloom upon the lea?" etc.<br /></span>
</div></div>


<h4>A TREE GAME&mdash;(SPRING OR FALL)</h4>

<p><i>Material.</i>&mdash;Leaves of the different trees with which
the children are familiar.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Glenn may be a maple tree.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Choose your leaf.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wallace may be an elm tree.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Choose your leaf.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 148]</span><span class="i0">Chauncey may be a birch tree.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Choose your leaf, etc.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Make a little forest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Toss in the wind.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>(The leaves are pinned upon the children as each
chooses his leaf, and they dance lightly about as if
tossed by the wind.)</p>


<h4>CARING FOR THE ANIMALS</h4>

<p><i>Material.</i>&mdash;Wooden or paper animals. A portion
of the table is marked off by a chalk line for the
farmyard.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Drive in a pig, Willie.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lead in a horse, Gregory.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drive in a sheep, Sadie.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lead in a cow, Roy, etc.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>They are driven in at night, then driven out in the
morning. Sometimes they are hurried in because of
the approach of a storm.</p>


<h4>DOLL PLAY&mdash;(GENERAL)</h4>

<p><i>Material.</i>&mdash;Penny dolls or larger ones.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Take a doll.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rock the baby.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pat the baby.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sing the baby to sleep.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Put the baby to bed.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 149]</span><span class="i0">Take up the baby.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wash its face.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Comb its hair.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Feed it bread and milk.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Take it for a walk.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>At the direction, "Sing the baby to sleep," the
children sing very softly:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Rock-a-bye Baby,"&mdash;or some other lullaby.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The bed is the chair on which the child is sitting.
All stand and turn about together to put the
babies to bed. They go through the movements
only of washing the face and hands and combing
the hair, and of feeding bread and milk. They perform
these acts in unison.</p>


<h4>THE RAINBOW FAIRIES&mdash;(SPRING)</h4>

<p><i>Material.</i>&mdash;Large bows of tissue paper with
streamers, of the various colors mentioned.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Eva may be a yellow fairy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Roy may be a blue fairy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Edith may be a green fairy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Louise may be a red fairy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lloyd may be an orange fairy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sadie may be a violet fairy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The others may be trees.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Join hands, fairies.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dance about the trees.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 150]</span></div></div>

<p>As the first direction is given Eva steps to the
table and takes a yellow bow which is pinned to
her left shoulder: the others follow as called upon.</p>


<h4>THE LEAVES</h4>

<p><i>Material.</i>&mdash;A leaf of one of several colors pinned
on each child. The wind calls:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Come yellow leaf.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come red leaf.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come green leaves, etc.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dance in the wind.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>At the last direction the children fly over a
small area, hither and thither; some one way, some
another, passing and repassing one another, simulating
the leaves in a storm.</p>


<h4>A FLOCK OF BIRDS</h4>

<p>All the children are little birds.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Fly to the fields.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Happy we, happy we.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We are little birdies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Singing in a tree."<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 151]</span></div></div>


<h4>HUNTING BIRDS</h4>

<p><i>Material.</i>&mdash;Colored pictures of birds common to
the locality in which the game is used.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Find a robin, Rudolph.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Find a bluebird, Gregory, etc.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The child indicated finds the picture of the bird
called for and places it on the blackboard ledge
which serves as a picture gallery.</p>


<h4>HUNTING LEAVES</h4>

<p>is a game similar to the above.</p>


<h4>MOVEMENT GAME</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Frederick may be a pony.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Louise may be a kitty, etc.<br /></span>

a bird; another, a horse; another, a fish; another, a
girl, etc.)</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Trot, pony.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Run, dog.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Skip, boy, etc.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>They perform singly, and also in a body.</p>


<h4>MAKING GARDEN</h4>

<p><i>Material.</i>&mdash;Trays or box-covers of sand, and a toy
set of garden tools for each pupil.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 152]</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Take the spade.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Smooth the ground.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Make holes (or rows).<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Plant corn (or sow the seed).<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cover the seed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Water the garden.<br /></span>
</div></div>


<h4>THE FARMER'S PETS</h4>

<p>For this game the children are all seated in chairs
except one for whom no chair is provided. Each
child seated takes the name of some animal on the
farm, <i>e.g.</i>, a dog, cat, horse, chicken, duck, or cow.
The one standing is the farm-hand and says, <i>e.g.</i>,
"My master wants his dog." The dog must jump up
and turn around. If he fails to do so, he steps to one
side taking his chair with him. If when he is again
called upon he answers correctly, he resumes his seat
in the circle. Occasionally the farm-hand says, "My
master wants all of his pets." When all rise and
change seats quietly. The farm-hand tries to get a
seat, leaving another child to be the farm-hand. In
changing seats they change names as a single name
belongs to each chair.</p>

the children have become thoroughly familiar with
them through oral presentation, after, too, the children
have gained some facility in reading, through
the use of the games, and the directions, etc., used in
the general management of the school. Before the
board work is presented the children dramatize
the story which they are to read. They look to
the board to find out what to say that they may impersonate
the character in the story. Each mimics
in tone and action the one whose part he takes. As
no two mimic in the same way there is no lack of
variety and interest. If the children are thoughtful
they will know every time into whose mouth to put
each sentence. They need to be alert, however. The
names of the speakers, given in the margin, are for
the benefit of the readers of this article. They are
not put on the board. The children do not need
them.</p>

<p><b>(III) <i>Nature Study as a Basis for the Reading.</i></b>
The subjects in which the pupils are most interested
are made the basis for the reading lessons.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 164]</span></p>

<p>Sometimes there is a guessing game like the following:
The teacher, holding a flower in her closed
hand, writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Guess what I have.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is a flower.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is white.<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>It has a yellow centre.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>(The children answer&mdash;a daisy.) Or&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Guess what I have.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is a leaf.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is yellow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is long.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is narrow.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>(The children answer&mdash;the willow.)</p>

<p>After the pupils have made a careful study of a
few birds or flowers, the reading lesson describes
one of these, and the pupils are expected to name
it from the description. If a child gives the wrong
name, one of those who know better points out the
line or lines barring out this object, and reads to the
one making the mistake as proof of his error.</p>

<span class="i0">This is a big bird.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is blue.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It has black bands on its tail and wings.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It has a crest.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">It scolds.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What is its name? (<i>The blue jay.</i>)<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The children sometimes play a game like the following:
All but one personify red-headed woodpeckers.
The <i>one</i> questions from the board. If a
red-headed woodpecker fails to answer the question
put to him, he takes the place of the interlocutor.
It is an honor to be able to answer all the questions
put:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>To a set of questions like the following, the children
give the answers, after reading the questions
silently:&mdash;</p>

<h4>THE BABY ROBIN</h4>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>I saw two robins on the ground.</p>

<p>One was a mamma robin.</p>

<p>The other was a baby robin.</p>

<p>The baby robin was as big as its mother.</p>

<p>Its breast was spotted.</p>

<p>Its mother gave it an earthworm.</p>

<p>At first it dropped it, but its mother picked it up
and gave it to her baby again.</p>

<p>This time it got a better hold. By several gulps
it swallowed the worm.</p>

<p>The mother looked proud of her baby. (This is
the teacher's experience which she tells the children
from the board. Sometimes she writes the observations
which one of the children have made.)</p>

<p>As no two teachers will have the same material<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 167]</span>
for Nature Study, the reading material will not be
multiplied here.</p>

<p>Gradually, as the pupils can stand it, the sentences
are lengthened a little as necessary, and massed
into paragraphs.</p>

<p>The use of the "Mother Goose Rhymes" as a means
of enlivening the first year reading lessons is also
treated as follows by Mrs. Lida McMurry. (Taken
from <i>School and Home Education</i> for October, 1902.)</p>

<p>Many of the children on entering school are well
versed in Nursery Rhymes. They enjoy repeating
them. Other children may not know them so well,
but soon learn them from their classmates. Teachers
and pupils may have a happy time together with
Mother Goose, and at the same time the pupils are
learning to read without realizing that what they are
doing is something that they are not accustomed to.</p>

<p>I will suggest a few ways in which these rhymes
may be made the basis for reading lessons:&mdash;</p>


<p>Take this rhyme&mdash;</p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class='linenum'>1.</span>  Dance, Thumbkin, dance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dance, ye merrymen, every one;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Thumbkin he can dance alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thumbkin he can dance alone.<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>The second, third, fourth, and fifth stanzas are like
the first, only Foreman, Longman, Ringman, and
Littleman are in turn substituted for Thumbkin.</p>

<p>The children first learn to act out each stanza as<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 168]</span>
they recite it together. The thumb is held up and
moved about as if dancing, as the first line is given.
All the fingers dance as the second line is recited.
The thumb dances alone as the third and fourth lines
are repeated.</p>

<p>The teacher then repeats the stanza alone, and the
children's fingers accompany her.</p>

<p>Later, when the children have learned to act out
the story well, as the teacher repeats it, the teacher
writes the first line at the board, and, pointing to it,
asks the children to do what the board directs. They
cannot tell what it is, so the teacher says, "The
board is talking to <i>Thumbkin</i>," writing the name on
the board as she says it. "What do you think it
wants Thumbkin to do?" pointing to <i>Dance</i> in the
line on the board. The next line is written on the
board. The children quite likely will guess rightly
what it says, because of its setting. If not, the
teacher will help them as at first. In the same way
they connect the third and fourth lines with the oral
expression of the same, and act them out accordingly.
That the children respond readily to the directions as
written is no proof, at first, that they know even most
of the words in the lines. The teacher's test is a part
of the play. To-day, instead of writing the first line,
she writes the second. Many get caught. They will
be more alert another time. As they can never tell
which line will appear first, they learn to discriminate
by giving closer attention to the form of the words.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 169]</span></p>

<p>Sometimes the teacher writes the six names&mdash;Thumbkin,
Foreman, etc., and Merrymen, on the
board. She points to the name or names of the one,
or ones, that should dance. The children do not like
to make mistakes in responding with the fingers.</p>

<p>Sometimes the teacher points to a name on the
board, as Foreman, and writes "dance alone," or
"dance every one." The alert children see that the
latter does not apply.</p>

<p>The words are not drilled upon. The game, with
variations sometimes, is played quite frequently, but
never so long at a time that the children weary
of it. Three or four plays or games are given at
a single recitation. The interests of the children
are studied, and rhymes which they do not enjoy
as reading material are dropped, and others substituted.
The rhymes should often be repeated,
just as they occur in "Mother Goose," that the
children may not forget them.</p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class='linenum'>2.</span>  Eye winker.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tom tinker.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mouth eater.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Chin chopper.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Chin chopper.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The children point to the parts of the face as they
are named. They first learn to give the rhyme with
its accompanying motion orally, then they respond to
it as written on the board (Tom tinker is the other<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 170]</span>
eye). When they do this readily the directions are
written out of their order. This tests the children's
ability to distinguish one form from another. No
child likes to give the wrong motion in response to a
direction, <i>e.g.</i>, point to his mouth when Eye winker
is called for.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class='linenum'>3.</span> The children, we will suppose, know a number of rhymes, as, <i>e.g.</i>,<br /></span>
</div></div>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A diller, a dollar, a ten o'clock scholar.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A little boy went into a barn.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Baa, baa, black sheep.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rain, rain, go away, etc.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The teacher writes the first line of one of these
rhymes on the board and asks a child to give the
rhyme. He cannot at first. Later he will learn to
recognize it; so with all the rhymes he knows. When
he can give any rhyme called for in response to the
first line as written at the board, another line (not
the first) is written, and the child asked to give the
rhyme of which it is a part.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class='linenum'>4.</span>  Is John Smith within?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yes, that he is.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can he set a shoe?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ay, marry, two.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here a nail and there a nail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tick, tack, too.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>After the children have learned the above rhyme,
acting it out, by imitating the voices of the two<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 171]</span>
speakers, and by driving the nails, the two questions
are asked at the board, and the children
respond orally. Sometimes the second question,
slightly altered, is asked first, <i>e.g.</i>, "Can John
Smith set a shoe?" Sometimes "Who is within?"
appears on the board.</p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class='linenum'>5.</span> Old Mother Hubbard.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There are many stanzas to this poem, a few of
which the teacher will wish to omit, as those referring
to the visits to the ale-house and the tavern.
The pupils become perfectly familiar with the jingle,
so they can with ease give it orally, then the teacher
writes the first line of a stanza at the board and pointing
to it asks a pupil to give the remainder of the
stanza. The mistake is ludicrous if the wrong lines
follow the first, and the pupils wish to avoid such
a mistake.</p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class='linenum'>6.</span> There were two birds sat on a stone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fa, la, la, la, lal, de.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One flew away and then there was one,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fa, la, la, la, lal, de.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The other flew after and then there was none,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fa, la, la, la, lal, de.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so the poor stone was left all alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fa, la, la, la, lal, de.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The children act out this rhyme at first as they say
it, later, silently, as they see what is called for at the
board.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 172]</span></p>

<p>Any number may be substituted for <i>two</i> in the
first line, but when they come to the third line the
number substituted for one should be such that only
one will remain, <i>e.g.</i>, There were <i>eight</i> birds sat on
a stone, <i>Seven</i> flew away, etc. The children are
sometimes caught by the wrong number being told
to fly. The children should not fly until they are
sure that it is all right.</p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class='linenum'>7.</span> What are your eyes for?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What are your ears for?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What is your nose for?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What is your tongue for?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What is your mouth for?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What is your hand for?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What are your fingers for?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What are your teeth for?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What is your brain for?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What is your heart for?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>These questions are read silently by the children,
then answered orally in complete sentences, one child
only answering at one time. The answers are so
absurd when wrong that each child is careful to
know what is asked.</p>

<p>These are only a few of the ways in which "Mother
Goose" may be used as reading material. Each
teacher will think out for herself ways in which these
rhymes may be profitably and happily employed.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h2><span class="smcap">Method in Primary Reading</span></h2>


<p>The problem of primary reading is one of the most
complex and difficult in the whole range of school
instruction. A large proportion of the finest skill
and sympathy of teachers has been expended in
efforts to find the appropriate and natural method of
teaching children to read. All sorts of methods and
devices have been employed, from the most formal
and mechanical to the most spirited and realistic.</p>

<p>The first requisite to good reading is something
worth reading, something valuable and interesting to
the children, and adapted to their minds. We must
take it for granted in this discussion that the best
literature and the best stories have been selected, and
what the teacher has to do is, first, to appreciate
these masterpieces for herself, and second, to bring
the children in the reading lessons to appreciate
and enjoy them. In the primary grades we are not
so richly supplied with available materials from good
literature as in intermediate and grammar grades.
This is due not to difficulty in thought, but to the
unfamiliar written and printed forms. The great
problem in primary reading is to master these strange
forms as quickly as possible, and find entrance to the<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 174]</span>
story-land of books. For several years, however, primary
teachers have been selecting and adapting
the best stories, and some of the leading publishers
have brought out in choice school-book form books
which are well adapted to the reading of primary
grades.</p>

<p>We should like to assume one other advantage.
If the children have been treated orally to "Robinson
Crusoe" in the second grade, they will appreciate and
read the story much better in the third grade. If
some of Grimm's stories are told in first grade, they
can be read with ease in the second grade. The
teacher's oral presentation of the stories is the right
way to bring them close to the life and interest of
children. In the first grade, as shown in the chapter
on oral lessons, it is the only way, because the children
cannot yet read. But even if they could read, the
oral treatment is much better. The oral presentation
is more lively, natural, and realistic. The teacher
can adapt the story and the language to the immediate
needs of the class as no author can. She
can question, or suggest lines of thought, or call up
ideas from the children's experience. The oral manner
is the true way to let the children delve into the
rich culture-content of stories and to awaken a taste
for their beauty and truth. We could well wish that
before children read mythical stories in fourth grade,
they had been stirred up to enjoy them by oral narration
and discussion in the preceding year. In the<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 175]</span>
same way, if the reading bears on interesting science
topics previously studied, it will be a distinct advantage
to the reading lesson. Children like to read
about things that have previously excited their interest,
whether in story or science. The difficulties of
formal reading will also be partly overcome by familiarity
with the harder names and words. Our conclusion
is that reading lessons, alone, cannot provide
all the conditions favorable to good reading. Some
of these can be well supplied by other studies or by
preliminary lessons which pave the way for the reading
proper. This matter has been so fully discussed
in the earlier chapters on oral work that it requires
no further treatment here.</p>


<h3>FOLK-LORE STORIES AS READING EXERCISES FOR
FIRST GRADE</h3>

<p>Let it be supposed that a class of first-grade children
has learned to tell a certain story orally. It has
interested them and stirred up their thought.</p>

<p>Let them next learn to read the same story in
a very simple form. This will lead to a series of
elementary reading lessons in connection with the
story, and the aim should be strictly that of mastering
the early difficulties of reading. The teacher
recalls the story, and asks for a statement from its
beginning. If the sentence furnished by the child is
simple and suitable, the teacher writes it on the blackboard
in plain large script. Each child reads it<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 176]</span>
through and points out the words. Let there be a
lively drill upon the sentence till the picture of each
word becomes clear and distinct. During the first
lesson, two or three short sentences can be handled
with success. As new words are learned, they should
be mixed up on the board with those learned before,
and a quick and varied drill on the words in sentences
or in columns be employed to establish the forms in
memory.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
Speed, variety in device, and watchfulness
to keep all busy and attentive are necessary to secure
good results.</p>

<p>After a few lessons one or two of the simpler
words may be taken for phonetic analysis. The
simple sounds are associated with the letters that
represent them. These familiar letters are later met
and identified in new words, and, as soon as a
number of sounds with their symbols have been
learned, new words can be constructed and pronounced
from these known elements.</p>

<p>The self-activity of the children in recognizing the
elementary sounds, already met, in new words as fast
as they come up, is one of the chief merits of this
early study of words. They thus early learn the
power of self-help and of confident reliance upon
themselves in acquiring and using knowledge. The
chief difficulty is in telling which sound to use, as a
letter often has several sounds (as <i>a</i>, <i>e</i>, <i>s</i>, <i>c</i>, etc.). But<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 177]</span>
the children are capable of testing the known sounds
of a letter upon a new word, and in most cases, of
deciding which to use. The thoughtless habit of
pronouncing every new word for a child, without
effort on his part, checks and spoils his interest and
self-activity. It does not seem necessary to use an
extensive system of diacritical markings to guide him
in these efforts to discriminate sounds. It is better
to use the marks as little as possible and learn to
interpret words as they usually appear in print.
Experience has shown decisively that a lively and
vigorous self-activity is manifested by such early
efforts in learning to read. It is one of the most
encouraging signs in education to see little children
in their first efforts to master the formal art of reading,
showing this spirited self-reliant energy.</p>

<p>In the same way, they recognize old words in
sentences and new or changed combinations of old
forms, and begin to read new sentences which combine
old words in new relations.</p>

<p>In short, the sentence, word, and phonic methods
are all used in fitting alternation, while originality and
variety of device are necessary in the best exercise of
teaching power.</p>

<p>The processes of learning to read by such board-script
work are partly analytic and partly synthetic.
Children begin with sentences, analyze them into
words, and some of the words into their simple
sounds. But when these sounds begin to grow<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 178]</span>
familiar, they are identified again in other words,
thus combining them into new forms. In the same
way, words once learned by the analytic study of
sentences are recognized again in new sentences, and
thus interpreted in new relations.</p>

<p>The short sentences, derived from a familiar story,
when ranged together supply a brief, simple outline
of the story. If now this series of sentences be
written on the board or printed on slips of paper,
the whole story may be reviewed by the class from
day to day till the word and sentence forms are well
mastered. For making these printed slips, some
teachers use a small printing-press, or a typewriter.
Eventually several stories may be collected and
sewed together, so as to form a little reading-book
which is the result of the constructive work of
teacher and pupils.</p>

<p>The reading lessons just described are entirely
separate from the oral treatment and reproduction of
the stories; yet the thought and interest awakened
in the oral work are helpful in keeping up a lively
effort in the reading class. The thought material in
a good story is itself a mental stimulus, and produces
a wakefulness which is favorable to imprinting the
forms as well as the content of thought. Expression,
also, that is, natural and vivid rendering of the
thought, is always aimed at in reading, and springs
spontaneously from interesting thought studies.</p>

<p>Many teachers use the materials furnished by oral<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 179]</span>
lessons in natural science as a similar introduction to
reading in first grade. The science lessons furnish
good thought matter for simple sentences, and there
is good reason why, in learning to read, children
should use sentences drawn both from literature and
from natural science.</p>


<h3>READING IN THE SECOND GRADE</h3>

<p>The oral lessons in good stories, and the later
board-use of these materials in learning the elements
of formal reading, are an excellent preparation for
the fuller and more extended reading of similar
matter in the second and third grades.</p>

<p>When the oral work of the first grade has thus
kindled the fancy of a child upon these charming
pictures, and the later board-work has acquainted
him with letter and word symbols which express such
thought, the reading of the same and other stories of
like character (a year later) will follow as an easy
and natural sequence. As a preliminary to all good
reading exercises, there should be rich and fruitful
thought adapted to the age of children. The realm
of classic folk-lore contains abundant thought material
peculiar in its fitness to awaken the interest and
fancy of children in the first two grades. To bring
these choice stories close to the hearts of children
should be the aim of much of the work in both these
grades. Such an aim, skilfully carried out, not only
conduces to the joy of children in first grade, but<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 180]</span>
infuses the reading lessons of second grade with
thought and culture of the best quality.</p>

<p>Interest and vigor of thought are certain to help
right expression and reading. Reading, like every
other study, should be based upon realities. When
there is real thought and feeling in the children, a
correct expression of them is more easily secured
than by formal demands or by intimidation.</p>

<p>The stories to be read in second or third grade
may be fuller and longer than the brief outline sentences
used for board-work in the first grade.
Besides, these tales, being classic and of permanent
value, do not lose their charm by repetition.</p>


<h3>METHOD</h3>

<p>By oral reading, we mean the giving of the
thought obtained from a printed page to others
through the medium of the voice.</p>

<p>There is first the training of the eye in taking in a
number of words at a glance&mdash;a mechanical process;
then the interpretation of these groups of words&mdash;a
mental process; next the making known of the
ideas thus obtained to others, by means of the voice&mdash;also
a mechanical process.</p>

<p>The children need special help in each step. We
are apt to overdo one at the expense of the others.</p>

<p>1. Eye-training is the foundation of all good reading.
Various devices are resorted to in obtaining it.
We will suggest a few, not new at all, but useful.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 181]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>(<i>a</i>) A strip of cardboard, on which is a clause or
sentence, is held before the class, for a moment only,
and then removed. The length of the task is increased
as the eye becomes trained to this kind of
work.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The children open their books at a signal from
the teacher, glance through a line, or part of one,
indicated by the teacher, close book at once and give
the line.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) The teacher places on the board clauses or
sentences bearing on the lesson, and covers with a
map. The map is rolled up to show one of these,
which is almost immediately erased. The children
are then asked to give it. The map is then rolled
up higher, exposing another, which also is speedily
erased&mdash;and so on until all have been given to the
children and erased.</p>
</div>

<p>2. The child needs not only to be able to recognize
groups of words, but he must be able to get thought
from them. The following are some devices to that
end:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>(<i>a</i>) Suggestive pictures can be made use of to
advantage all through the primary grades. If the
child reads part of the story in the picture, and finds
it interesting, he will want to read from the printed
page the part not given in the picture.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Where there is no picture&mdash;or even where
there is one&mdash;an aim may be useful to arouse interest
in the thought, <i>i.e.</i> a thoughtful question may be put<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 182]</span>
by the teacher, which the children can answer only
by reading the story; <i>e.g.</i> in the supplementary
reader, "Easy Steps for Little Feet," is found the
story of "The Pin and Needle." There is no picture.
The teacher says, as the class are seated: "Now we
have a story about a big quarrel between a pin and a
needle over the question, 'Which one is the better
fellow?' Of what could the needle boast? Of what
the pin? Let us see which won."</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Let all the pupils look through one or more
paragraphs, reading silently, to get the thought,
before any one is called upon to read aloud. If a
child comes to a word that he does not know, during
the silent reading, the teacher helps him to get it&mdash;from
the context if possible&mdash;if not, by the sounds
of the letters which compose it.</p>
</div>

<p>As each child finishes the task assigned, he raises
his eyes from the book, showing by this act that he
is ready to tell what he has just read. The thought
may be given by the child in his own language to
assure the teacher that he has it. Usually, however,
in the lower grades, this is unnecessary, the language
of the book being nearly as simple as his own.</p>

<p>The advantage of having all the pupils kept busy,
instead of one alone who might be called upon to
read the paragraph, is evident. Every child reads
silently all of the lesson. Time would not permit
that this be done orally, were it advisable to do so.
When the child gets up to read, he is not likely to<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 183]</span>
stumble, for he has both the thought and the expression
for it, at the start.</p>

<p>While aiming to have the children comprehend the
thought, the teacher should not forget, on the other
hand, that this is the reading hour, and not the time
for much oral instruction and reproduction. There
are other recitations in which the child is trained to
free oral expression of thought, as in science and
literature. Such offhand oral expression of his own
ideas is not the primary aim of the reading lesson.
Its purpose is to lend life to the recitation.</p>

<p>3. Steps 1 and 2 deal with preparation for the reading.
Up to this time, no oral reading has been done.
Now we are ready to begin.</p>

<p>Children will generally express the thought with
the proper emphasis if they not only see its meaning
but also feel it. Suppose the children are interested
in the thought of the piece, they still fail, sometimes,
to give the proper emphasis. How can the teacher,
by questioning, get them to realize the more important
part of the thought?</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>(<i>a</i>) The teacher has gone deeper into the meaning
than have the children. Her questions should
be such as to make real to the children the more
emphatic part of the thought; <i>e.g.</i> in the Riverside
Primer we have, "Poor Bun, good dog, did you think
I meant to hit you?" John reads, "Do you think I
meant to <i>hit</i> you?" The teacher says, "I will be
Bun, John. What is it that you do not want Bun to<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 184]</span>
think?" ("That I <i>meant</i> to hit him.") "But you
did mean to hit something. What was it you did not
mean to hit? Tell Bun." ("I did not <i>mean</i> to hit
<i>you</i>.") Now ask him if he thought that you did.
("Did you think I <i>meant</i> to hit <i>you</i>?")</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) When the story is in the form of a dialogue,
the children may personate the characters in the
story. Thus, getting into the real spirit of the piece,
their emphasis will naturally fall where it properly
belongs.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Sometimes the teacher will find it necessary to
show the child how to read a passage properly, by
reading it himself. It is seldom best to do this&mdash;certainly
not if the correct expression can be reached
through questioning.</p>
</div>

<p>Many a teacher makes a practice of giving the
proper emphasis to the child, he copying it from her
voice. Frequently, children taught in this way can
read one piece after another in their readers with
excellent expression, but, when questioned, show that
their minds are a blank as to the meaning of what
they are reading.</p>

<p>In working for expression, a great many teachers
waste the time and energy of the pupils by indefinite
directions. The emphasis is not correctly placed, so
the teacher says, "I do not like that; try it again,
May." Now, May has no idea in what particular she
has failed, so she gives it again, very likely as she
gave it before, or she may put the emphasis on some<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 185]</span>
other word, hoping by so doing to please the teacher.
"Why, no, May, you surely can do better than that,"
says the teacher. So May makes another fruitless
attempt, when the teacher, disgusted, calls on another
pupil to show her how to read. May has gained no
clearer insight into the thought than she started out
with, no power to grapple more successfully with a
similar difficulty another time, and has lost, partly
at least, her interest in the piece. She has been
bothered and discouraged, and the class wearied.</p>

<p>Sometimes when the expression is otherwise good,
the children pitch their voices too high or too low.
Natural tones must be insisted upon. A good aid to
the children in this respect is the habitual example of
quiet, clear tones in the teacher.</p>

<p>Another fault of otherwise good reading is a failure
to enunciate distinctly. Children are inclined to
slight many sounds, especially at the end of the
words, and the teacher is apt to think: "That doesn't
make so very much difference, since they are only
children. When they are older they will see that
their pronunciation is babyish, and adopt a correct
form." This is unsound reasoning. Every time the
child says <i>las</i> for <i>last</i> he is establishing more firmly
a habit, to overcome which will give him much
difficulty.</p>

<p>In the pronunciation of words as well as in the
reading of a sentence, much time is wasted through
failure to point out the exact word, and the syllable<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 186]</span>
in the word, in which the mistake has been made.
The child cannot improve unless he knows in what
particular there is room for improvement.</p>

<p>Children in primary grades should be supplied with
a good variety of primers, readers, and simple story
books. In the course of their work they should read
through a number of first, second, and third readers.
Much of this reading should be simple and easy, so
that they can move rapidly through a book, and gain
confidence and satisfaction from it. In each grade
there should be several sets of readers, which can be
turned to as the occasion may demand. It is much
better to read a new reader, involving in the main the
same vocabulary, than to reread an old book. This
use of several books in each grade adds to the interest
and reduces to a minimum the mere drills, which are
to be avoided as much as possible.</p>


<h3>SUMMARY</h3>

<p>1. Let children read under the impulse of strong
and interesting thought.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>(<i>a</i>) The previous oral treatment of the stories
now used as reading lessons will help this thought
impulse.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) An aim concretely stated, and touching an interesting
thought in the lesson, will give impetus to the
work.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Let children pass judgment on the truth, worth,
or beauty of what they read.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 187]</span></p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) Clear mental pictures of people, actions, places,
etc., conduce to vigor of thought. To this end the
teacher should use good pictures, make sketches, and
give descriptions or explanations. Children should
also be allowed to sketch freely at the board.</p>
</div>

<p>2. Children should be encouraged constantly to
help themselves in interpreting new words and sentences
in reading.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>(<i>a</i>) By looking through the new sentence and making
it out, if possible, for themselves before any one
reads it aloud.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) By analyzing a new word into its sounds, and
then combining them to get its pronunciation.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) By interpreting a new word from its context, or
by the first sound or syllable.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) By using the new powers of the letters as fast
as they are learned in interpreting new words.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) By trying the different sounds of a letter to a
new word to see which seems to fit best.</p>

<p>(<i>f</i>) By recognizing familiar words in new sentences
with a different context.</p>

<p>(<i>g</i>) See that every child reads the sentences in the
new lesson for himself.</p>
</div>

<p>3. There should be a gradual introduction to the
elementary sounds (powers of the letters).</p>

<p>The first words analyzed should be simple and
phonetic in spelling, as <i>dog</i>, <i>hen</i>, <i>cat</i>, etc.</p>

<p>New sounds of letters are taught as the children
need them in studying out new words.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 188]</span></p>

<p>Very little attention needs to be given to learning
the names of the letters.</p>

<p>There need be little use of diacritical markings in
early reading.</p>

<p>4. Many of the new words will occur in connection
with the picture at the head of the lesson. Place
these on the board as they come up.</p>

<p>If the teacher will weave these words into her conversation,
they will give the children little future trouble.</p>

<p>5. All the different phases of the phonic, word, and
sentence method should be woven together by a skilful
teacher.</p>

<p>6. The close attention of all the members of the
class, so that each reads through the whole lesson,
should be an ever-present aim of the teacher.</p>

<p>7. Children should be trained to grasp several
words at a glance:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>(<i>a</i>) By quick writing and erasure of words and
sentences at the board.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) By exposing for an instant sentences covered
by a screen.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) By the use of phrases or short sentences on
cardboard.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) By questions for group thought.</p>
</div>

<p>These tests should increase in difficulty with growing
skill.</p>

<p>8. Spend but little time in the oral reproduction of
stories. Practice in good reading and interpretation
is the main thing.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 189]</span></p>

<p>9. Children, from the first, should be encouraged
to articulate distinctly in oral reading. Let the
teacher begin at home.</p>

<p>10. Let the teacher cultivate a pleasing tone of
voice, not loud or harsh. This will help the children
to the same.</p>

<p>11. Vigorous and forcible expression is secured:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>(<i>a</i>) By having interesting stories.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) By apt questions to bring out the emphatic
thought.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) By dramatizing the scenes of the story.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) By occasional examples of lively reading by
the teacher.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) By definiteness in questioning.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">List of Books for Primary Grades</span></h2>


<p>In selecting reading books for primary grades the
purpose is to find those which will give the readiest
mastery of the printed forms of speech.</p>

<p>For this purpose books need to be well graded and
interesting. Primary teachers have expended their
utmost skill upon such simple, attractive, and interesting
books for children. Pictorial illustration has
added to the clearness and beauty of the books, so
that, with the rivalry of many large publishing
houses, we now have a great variety of good primary
books to select from.</p>

<p>The earliest and simplest of these are the primers,
which, followed by the first readers, give the most
necessary drills upon the forms of easy words and
sentences. Great care has been taken to give an
easy regular grading so as to let a child help himself
as much as possible. But as soon as children, by
blackboard exercises and by means of primers,
have gained a mastery of the simpler words and the
powers of the letters, the Mother Goose rhymes, the
fables and fairy tales (already familiar to the children<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 191]</span>
in oral work) are introduced into their reading books
in the simplest possible forms.</p>

<p>The use of interesting rhymes and stories in this early
reading is the only means of giving it a lively content
and of thus securing interest and concentration of
thought. Good primary teachers have been able in
this way to relieve the reading lessons of their tedium,
and, what is equally good, have strengthened the interest
of the children in the best literature of childhood.</p>

<p>Besides the choicest fables and fairy tales, many
of the simpler nature myths and even such longer
poems and stories as "Hiawatha," "Robinson Crusoe,"
and "Ulysses" have been used with happy results
as reading books in the first three years. There
are also certain collections of children's poems, such
as Stevenson's "Child's Garden of Verses," Field's
"Love-songs of Childhood," Sherman's "Little Folk
Lyrics," "Old Ballads in Prose," "The Listening
Child," and others, which may suggest the beauty and
variety of choice literary materials which are now
easily within the reach of teachers and children in
primary schools.</p>

<p>There is no longer any doubt that little folk in
primary classes may reap the full benefit of a close
acquaintance with these favorite songs, stories, and
poems, and that in the highest educative sense the
effect is admirable.</p>

<p>In the following list the books for each grade are
arranged into three groups:<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 192]</span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>First.</i> A series of choicest books and those extensively
used and well adapted for the grade as regular
reading exercises.</p>

<p><i>Second.</i> A supplementary list of similar quality
and excellence, but somewhat more difficult.</p>

<p>They may, in some cases, serve as substitutes for
those given in the first group.</p>

<p><i>Third.</i> A collection of books for teachers, partly
similar in character to those mentioned in the two
previous groups and partly of a much wider, professional
range in literature, history, and nature. Some
books of child-study, psychology, and pedagogy are
also included. The problems of the primary teacher
are no longer limited to the small drills and exercises
in spelling and reading, but comprehend many of the
most interesting and far-reaching questions of education.
It is well, therefore, for the primary teacher to
become acquainted not only with the great works of
literature but with the best professional books in
education.</p>

By <span class="smcap">CHARLES A. McMURRY</span><br /><br />

New edition, revised and enlarged. Cloth. 12mo. 331 pp.<br />
90 cents net, postage 10 cents</p>

<p>This volume discusses fully the controlling principles of our progressive
modern education, such as The Aim of Education; The Materials
and Sources of Moral Training; The Relative Value of Studies in the
School Course; The Nature and Value of Interest as a Vital Element
in Instruction; The Correlation of Studies; Inductive and Deductive
Processes as Fundamental to All Thinking; Apperception, its Close
and Constant Application to the Process of Learning; The Will, its
Training and Function and its Close Relation to Other Forms of
Mental Action.</p>

<p>The book closes with an account of Herbart and his disciples in
Germany, and a summary of their pronounced ideas and influence
upon education.</p>

New edition, revised and enlarged<br />

By <span class="smcap">CHARLES A. McMURRY</span> and <span class="smcap">FRANK M. McMURRY</span><br /><br />

Cloth. 12mo. 339 pp. 90 cents net, postage 10 cents</p>

<p>This book, as a whole, is designed to simplify, organize, and illustrate
the chief principles of class-room method in elementary schools. A few
important fundamental principles are carefully worked out as a basis.
The essential steps, in the acquisition of knowledge in all studies, are
worked out and applied to different branches. The developing method
of instruction so much used in the oral treatment of lessons is worked
out, and the method of careful and suitable questioning discussed.</p>

<p>Two chapters are given, consisting of Illustrative Lessons selected
from the different studies and worked out in full, as examples of a right
method. In these examples, and also in the discussions, the application
of the principles of apperception, interest, induction, and deduction
to class-room work are shown. The peculiar application of these
various principles to different studies is carefully discussed.</p>
